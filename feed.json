Coming just three months before local council elections in May, it is full of what many voters will see as nothing more than simple electoral bribes.</p>\n<p>Ealing Labour Leader Peter Mason hailed it as the first council budget in sixteen years that doesn&rsquo;t cut frontline services such as <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/about/what-local-government\">social care, schools, housing and planning and waste collection</a>.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s quite an admission.</p>\n<p>Sixteen years of Ealing Labour cutting frontline services as if they were Tories.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ealing Labour always blamed the national Tory government cuts to local government funding. They had no choice to make the &ldquo;difficult choices&rdquo; that were effectively imposed upon them by a hard-right Tory central government.</p>\n<p>What else could they do?</p>\n<p>At least they did it in a more professional and grown-up way than Ealing Conservatives would have done!</p>\n<p>And let&rsquo;s just pretend that Peter Mason didn&rsquo;t spend much of his time between 2015 and 2019 in cahoots with &ldquo;the Dark Lord&rdquo; Peter Mandelson - the disgraced best friend of convicted paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein - in trying to undermine Jeremy Corbyn every single day.</p>\n<p>Corbyn isn&rsquo;t perfect, but a Corbyn-led Labour government in 2019 would certainly have provided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/jeremy-corbyn-urges-public-to-vote-for-his-manifesto-of-hope-labour-tax-spend-plans\">increased funding</a> to local authorities.</p>\n<p>Instead, self-identifying &ldquo;left-wing&rdquo; Mason made the &ldquo;difficult choice&rdquo; to <a href=\"https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/statement/a-shameful-day-for-the-jlm/\">withdraw support</a> and effectively hand the election to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/11/boris-johnsons-record-of-bigotry-antisemitism-and-far-right-politics-must-not-be-forgotten\">known anti-Semite, all-round racist</a>, liar and &ldquo;killer clown&rdquo; Boris Johnson. Never <a href=\"https://www.ealinglabour.com/manifesto2022/\">on your side</a>.</p>\n<p>After Corbyn&rsquo;s successor as Labour Leader Keir Starmer won a landslide General Election last year against a Tory Party reeling after five years of chaos and confusion under Johnson, Truss and Sunak, Mason was clearly delighted to announce additional central government funding.</p>\n<p>But with Starmer generating his own chaos by <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/12/corbyn-alleges-uk-complicity-after-streetings-admission-of-gaza-abuses\">supporting war crimes by Israel</a> and embroiled in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czej4ep882ko\">a scandal of his own making</a> with his appointment of Peter Mandelson as the British Ambassador to the US despite knowing of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_of_Peter_Mandelson_and_Jeffrey_Epstein\">Mandelson&rsquo;s continued friendship with the convicted paedophile Epstein</a>, national Labour&rsquo;s stock is at an all-time low.</p>\n<p>Similar to by-elections, local elections are often a convenient opportunity for the general public to voice their frustration with, and opposition to, national government policies and failures with a protest vote against the ruling party.</p>\n<p>Ealing Labour councillors must be very concerned that many of them will lose their <a href=\"https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&amp;spage=common/eacouncil220.htm\">massively increased allowances</a> in May, thanks to the actions of Starmer&rsquo;s national Labour Party.</p>\n<p>In the lead-up to the elections, therefore, their leader Peter Mason has seized the opportunity to take back the local initiative with a financial package of &ldquo;improved&rdquo; frontline services, including action on fly-tipping.</p>\n<p>One of the big local (and national) issues now in Ealing, and especially Southall, is fly-tipping, with the perception across the borough that the problem, while not new, has got significantly worse in recent years.</p>\n<h1 id=\"a-quick-recap-of-how-we-got-here\">A quick recap of how we got here</h1>\n<p>In 2003, &ldquo;Filthy streets, dirty parks, a growing drug problem and overcrowding mark Southall as suffering &lsquo;inner-city deprivation&rsquo;&rdquo;, then <a href=\"https://www.ealingtimes.co.uk/news/54754.southalls-inner-city-deprivation/\">London Mayor Ken Livingstone admitted</a>.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, Southallians <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040615012717/http://www.southallgasworks.com/Media/ConsultationReport.pdf\">complained about rubbish and litter</a> on our streets in response to a consultation on the possible development of the old Southall Gasworks site.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&mdash;</p>\n<p>In 2010, soon after Peter Mason arrived in the borough, he was complaining about his new neighbours on Facebook, who - quite possibly - were rooting through his trash in the night:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;How many times must i be woken up by their squeaking?&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rather than set an example and <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2026/01/22/its-never-enough-until-its/\">report a noise nuisance</a> via the council website like a normal person, Mason proposed a <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2022/03/19/ealing-labour-leaks/\">callous, ruthless</a> and deadly violent solution:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;will somebody please shoot these fucking foxes in Acton!&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>It was after Mason&rsquo;s arrival that Ealing Labour under ten leader Julian Bell made the &ldquo;difficult choice&rdquo; to freeze council tax every year while the national Tory government cut their funding by 60%.</p>\n<p>Of course, they wanted to protect the majority of people suffering under Tory and LibDem imposed national austerity from having to pay more council tax. But in doing so they reduced further still the amount of money available to sustain local services.</p>\n<p>Cynics might point out that Bell was afraid that raising council tax would be vote loser. Instead, in order to retain power, he made the &ldquo;difficult choices&rdquo; to raise funds and save money by <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2022/03/25/ealing-monopoly/\">selling off Ealing&rsquo;s public assets</a> and cutting frontline services - including adult social care services in Southall, and a 50% reduction in waste collection across the borough.</p>\n<p>In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/neighbourly-care-southall-fights-back-9700892\">residents protested</a> against these cuts outside Ealing Town Hall.

I’m trying my very best.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a not uncommon sight here to see disabled people forced to risk their lives by walking with their mobility aids in the road because the pavements are impassable due to rubbish bags, mattresses, fridges, broken glass, illegally parked cars, and broken pavements.</p>\n<p>Also last year, my brilliant community pharmacist, Rahul Puri, explained the <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfJ3fLA/\">serious public health harms</a> arising directly as a result of the dramatic rise of fly-tipping in Southall, an area already extremely vulnerable to <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/categories/health/\">health problems</a> and stressors.</p>\n<h1 id=\"fly-tipping-doubled-when-weekly-rubbish-collections-ended-in-2016\">Fly-tipping doubled when weekly rubbish collections ended in 2016</h1>\n<p><strong>Official government data shows the number of fly-tipping incidents doubled after 2016 and the introduction of fortnightly wheelie bin collections. Ealing Council&rsquo;s own numbers show it costs millions. And the solution they won&rsquo;t consider would save £1-1.6 million per year.</strong></p>\n<p>What actually happened is recorded in the government&rsquo;s own statistics: fly-tipping in Ealing doubled overnight and has cost council taxpayers millions every year since.</p>\n<p>Three months after weekly collections ended, the council was already announcing a <a href=\"https://www.aroundealing.com/news/finding-and-fining-the-fly-tippers/\">fly-tipping crackdown</a>. In November 2016, it reported that new taskforce crews had visited 763 streets and traced dumped waste back to 1,124 addresses in just three months. The message from cabinet member Bassam Mahfouz was simple: “We will find you and we will fine you.”</p>\n<p>The enforcement narrative was in place almost immediately after the service change - just as the official data shows fly-tipping doubling across the borough.It’s hard to escape the impression that the council knew the service change would create a problem and prepared to police the consequences rather than reconsider the policy itself.</p>\n<p>Some might argue the rise could simply reflect better reporting rather than more fly-tipping. But the data shows a different pattern. Incidents were stable for years, then almost exactly doubled in the same year weekly collections ended - and have remained at that higher level ever since. Reporting changes usually produce short-term spikes or gradual trends. What Ealing’s figures show is a sudden, permanent step-change, which strongly suggests a real increase in dumping rather than just better record-keeping.</p>\n<p>Ealing Council now spends <strong><a href=\"https://www.aroundealing.com/news/fly-tippers-pay-for-their-actions/\">£3 million annually</a></strong> clearing fly-tipping whilst claiming the problem is down to residents' behaviour.</p>\n<p>Now Ealing Southall&rsquo;s MP and formerly Peter Mason&rsquo;s deputy leader of the council, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/E_NoNRlJasw\">Deirdre Costigan</a> visited Southall Green in March 2022 to launch yet another ineffective authoritarian pre-election crackdown on fly-tipping. Costigan said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here in Southall today with our fly-tip enforcement and clearing team to talk about our new zero tolerance approach to illegal dumping. Ealing is a brilliant place to live but a small minority of people spoil things for the rest of us by fly tipping in our borough.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She claimed that this small minority of people in Southall &ldquo;don&rsquo;t play by the rules&rdquo; and that their actions are &ldquo;disgusting, irresponsible and illegal.&rdquo; She also states that the council&rsquo;s CCTV surveillance and enforcement mechanisms are inadequate.</p>\n<p>But the government data tells a different story: <strong>Ealing Council created the problem, spent ten years managing the symptoms, and refuses to consider the solution because it would mean admitting the original policy was a catastrophic mistake.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"what-the-official-data-shows\">What the official data shows</h1>\n<p>The table below uses <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-statistics-for-england\">Defra&rsquo;s national fly-tipping dataset</a>, with population-adjusted rates per 1,000 residents to control for population growth.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th>Total Incidents</th>\n<th>Population</th>\n<th>Incidents per 1,000 residents</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2012–13</td>\n<td>6,352</td>\n<td>336,900</td>\n<td>18.9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2013–14</td>\n<td>5,765</td>\n<td>338,000</td>\n<td>17.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2014–15</td>\n<td>7,257</td>\n<td>339,000</td>\n<td>21.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2015–16</td>\n<td>7,032</td>\n<td>339,700</td>\n<td>20.7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2016–17</strong></td>\n<td><strong>14,270</strong></td>\n<td><strong>340,000</strong></td>\n<td><strong>42.0</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2017–18</td>\n<td>13,610</td>\n<td>340,500</td>\n<td>40.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2019–20</td>\n<td>13,115</td>\n<td>341,806</td>\n<td>38.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2020–21</td>\n<td>13,090</td>\n<td>340,341</td>\n<td>38.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2021–22</td>\n<td>12,303</td>\n<td>366,762</td>\n<td>33.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2022–23</td>\n<td>12,922</td>\n<td>369,937</td>\n<td>34.9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2023–24</td>\n<td>16,828</td>\n<td>375,340</td>\n<td>44.8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>The pattern is undeniable:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Four years of stability</strong> (2012–16): Fly-tipping averaged 17–21 incidents per 1,000 residents</li>\n<li><strong>One year of catastrophe</strong> (2016–17): Jumped to 42 incidents per 1,000 residents</li>\n<li><strong>Eight years of plateau</strong> (2017–24): Remained at 33–45 incidents per 1,000 residents</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>That&rsquo;s a 137% increase per person</strong> from 2012–13 to 2023–24.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t explained by population growth.

fly-tipping incidents.</strong></p>\n<p>From 2012–13 to 2015–16, Ealing recorded <strong>26,406 total incidents.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>That&rsquo;s 81,609 additional incidents over eight years</strong> compared to pre-wheelie bin rates.</p>\n<p>Even at the conservative clearance cost of £178 per incident, that&rsquo;s <strong>£14.5 million in additional fly-tipping costs</strong> since the policy change.</p>\n<p><strong>The claimed £1.7 million annual savings?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wiped out more than eight times over.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"the-enforcement-paradox\">The enforcement paradox</h2>\n<p>You might argue that enforcement has improved, so comparing to pre-2016 isn&rsquo;t fair.</p>\n<p><strong>The data proves this defence is worthless:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2012–16 average:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fine recovery rate: ~34% of clearance costs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2025:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fine recovery rate: ~44–67% of clearance costs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>So yes, enforcement has significantly improved.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>But the total volume has increased so much that even with better recovery rates, taxpayers now pay £1–1.7 million annually vs £281,000 pre-2016.</strong></p>\n<p>Better enforcement of a much worse problem still costs far more than preventing the problem in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Ealing Labour&rsquo;s rubbish collection scheme doubled fly-tipping and cost eight times more to clean up the mess they created than they saved by stopping weekly waste removal</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"the-perverse-incentive\">The perverse incentive</h1>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where it gets darkly absurd.</p>\n<p>If the council actually collected the maximum £1,000 fine for all 3,328 enforcement actions:</p>\n<p><strong>Fine income: £3,328,000</strong><br>\n<strong>Clearance costs: £3,000,000</strong><br>\n<strong>Net profit: £328,000</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The council would be making money from fly-tipping.</strong></p>\n<p>Now, they&rsquo;re not actually collecting £1,000 per fine — most are Fixed Penalty Notices at lower amounts, and many go unpaid. But the theoretical possibility exists.</p>\n<p><strong>And that creates a perverse incentive:</strong></p>\n<p>The more fly-tipping occurs, the more enforcement opportunities exist, the more fine income potentially flows in.</p>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s like something out of Catch-22.</strong></p>\n<p>Milo Minderbinder would be proud: create a problem through policy change, establish an enforcement regime, generate revenue from the problem you created, claim you&rsquo;re &ldquo;tackling&rdquo; the issue whilst financially benefiting from its continuation.</p>\n<p><strong>Everyone in the syndicate gets richer — except the residents whose streets are covered in rubbish and who are paying for enforcement through their council tax.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"the-childrens-centres-connection\">The children&rsquo;s centres connection</h1>\n<p>In 2023–24, Ealing Council began consulting on closing 10 of the borough&rsquo;s 25 <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local/\">children&rsquo;s centres</a>, claiming budget pressures.</p>\n<p>The projected savings?

Environmental rhetoric masking cost-cutting</strong><br>\nPromised &ldquo;cleaner streets&rdquo; whilst implementing cost-saving measures that created the opposite outcome.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Costs externalised onto residents</strong><br>\nFortnightly collections create storage problems in terraced housing, HMOs and all the new tower blocks (Southall&rsquo;s predominant housing types). Residents bear the burden whilst council claims savings.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Claims contradicted by measurable outcomes</strong><br>\nPromised streets would be &ldquo;cleaner.&rdquo; Data shows fly-tipping doubled and remained at that level for eight years.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Blame shifted to residents</strong><br>\nWhen policy causes problem, council blames &ldquo;behaviour&rdquo; and &ldquo;awareness&rdquo; rather than examining whether the policy itself failed.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Expensive symptom management instead of admitting failure</strong><br>\nSpend £1.9 million on enforcement rather than £1.7 million on service improvement, because the latter would require admitting the original policy was wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>7. No outcomes evaluation</strong><br>\nReport activity statistics (investigations, fines, warnings) without ever asking: &ldquo;Did the policy we implemented in 2016 cause the doubling? Should we reverse it?&rdquo;</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"what-this-proves\">What this proves</h1>\n<p><strong>1. The data is undeniable</strong><br>\nFly-tipping per resident almost exactly doubled in the year after fortnightly collections were introduced. No other borough-wide change explains the timing or scale.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The cost is substantial</strong><br>\n£14.5 million in additional clearance costs over eight years, plus £1.9 million annual enforcement spending, far exceeds the claimed £1.7 million annual savings.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The solution is obvious</strong><br>\nReturn to weekly collections. It would be cheaper, more effective, and address the root cause rather than managing symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>4. The political calculation is clear</strong><br>\nThe council prioritises avoiding admission of policy failure over fiscal responsibility and effectiveness.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Residents were right all along</strong><br>\nThe 7,000+ people who opposed wheelie bins, the residents who predicted fly-tipping would increase, the community members who&rsquo;ve complained for eight years — they were all correct.</p>\n<p><strong>6.

				"content_text": "This is the shocking story of how for sixteen years Ealing Labour councillors talked rubbish about having to make \"difficult choices\" to cut services to save money, ignoring thousands of residents' protests, and in doing so created a massive mess that a decade later still costs millions to clean up every year and leaves children's and disabled people's lives unnecessarily poorer.  \n\nIt's a story about an ambitious New Labour leader - [politically aligned with Tony Blair](https://southallstories.uk/2025/09/26/ealing-for-sale/) and his campaign director in 1997, the three times disgraced ex-Lord [Peter Mandelson](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/10/peter-mandelson-new-labour-jeffrey-epstein-corporate-power) - who makes bad choices that harm the very people (and their children) who elected him to represent them in Southall Green, one of the poorest council wards in Ealing.  \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260213-094729.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\" alt=\"A LinkedIn post from Peter Mason talking rubbish and discussing a campaign in Ealing to reduce fly-tipping and change resident behavior, highlighting specific achievements and initiatives, signed off with Bangarang.\">  \n\n---\n\nNot only do his bad choices harm vulnerable people who [deserve better](https://open.substack.com/pub/southall/p/southall-deserves-better), Ealing Labour's \"solution\" to the problem they created is to blame and punish their victims - with fewer frontline services they need the most, more authoritarian and privacy-violating surveillance, and harsher financial punishments for and criminalisation of often [unfortunate individuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ealing/s/JD2n25UHIk) who can't afford to pay huge fines, while allowing actual criminal fly-tippers to carry-on and get away scot-free.  \n\n\nSeemingly oblivious (or maybe not) to the chaos and disorder caused, he celebrates spending millions more than he saved on enforcement by trumpeting his \"listening to residents\" and his enforcement \"achievements\" on TV and LinkedIn, signing off with a Boris Johnson-esque \"Bangarang\".\n\n\n---\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/pxl-20260210-115133587.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"451\" alt=\"Ruskin Hall in Acton, Ealing Labour Party's official HQ, with a sign for The Labour Party and some fly-tipped rubbish bags on the pavement out front.\">\n\n\n---\n# Bangarang Pete\n\nEaling Council last week announced their [draft budget](https://www.ealing.news/news/ealing-council-unveils-2026-27-budget-plans/) for the coming financial year 2026-27. Coming just three months before local council elections in May, it is full of what many voters will see as nothing more than simple electoral bribes. \n\n\nEaling Labour Leader Peter Mason hailed it as the first council budget in sixteen years that doesn't cut frontline services such as [social care, schools, housing and planning and waste collection](https://www.local.gov.uk/about/what-local-government). \n\n\nThat's quite an admission. \n\n\nSixteen years of Ealing Labour cutting frontline services as if they were Tories. \n\n\nOf course, Ealing Labour always blamed the national Tory government cuts to local government funding. They had no choice to make the \"difficult choices\" that were effectively imposed upon them by a hard-right Tory central government. \n\n\nWhat else could they do? \n\n\nAt least they did it in a more professional and grown-up way than Ealing Conservatives would have done! \n\n\nAnd let's just pretend that Peter Mason didn't spend much of his time between 2015 and 2019 in cahoots with \"the Dark Lord\" Peter Mandelson - the disgraced best friend of convicted paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein - in trying to undermine Jeremy Corbyn every single day. \n\n\nCorbyn isn't perfect, but a Corbyn-led Labour government in 2019 would certainly have provided [increased funding](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/jeremy-corbyn-urges-public-to-vote-for-his-manifesto-of-hope-labour-tax-spend-plans) to local authorities. \n\n\nInstead, self-identifying \"left-wing\" Mason made the \"difficult choice\" to [withdraw support](https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/statement/a-shameful-day-for-the-jlm/) and effectively hand the election to [known anti-Semite, all-round racist](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/11/boris-johnsons-record-of-bigotry-antisemitism-and-far-right-politics-must-not-be-forgotten), liar and \"killer clown\" Boris Johnson. Never [on your side](https://www.ealinglabour.com/manifesto2022/).\n\n\nAfter Corbyn's successor as Labour Leader Keir Starmer won a landslide General Election last year against a Tory Party reeling after five years of chaos and confusion under Johnson, Truss and Sunak, Mason was clearly delighted to announce additional central government funding. \n\n\nBut with Starmer generating his own chaos by [supporting war crimes by Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/12/corbyn-alleges-uk-complicity-after-streetings-admission-of-gaza-abuses) and embroiled in [a scandal of his own making](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czej4ep882ko) with his appointment of Peter Mandelson as the British Ambassador to the US despite knowing of [Mandelson's continued friendship with the convicted paedophile Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_of_Peter_Mandelson_and_Jeffrey_Epstein), national Labour's stock is at an all-time low.\n\n\nSimilar to by-elections, local elections are often a convenient opportunity for the general public to voice their frustration with, and opposition to, national government policies and failures with a protest vote against the ruling party. \n\n\nEaling Labour councillors must be very concerned that many of them will lose their [massively increased allowances](https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&spage=common/eacouncil220.htm) in May, thanks to the actions of Starmer's national Labour Party.\n\n\nIn the lead-up to the elections, therefore, their leader Peter Mason has seized the opportunity to take back the local initiative with a financial package of \"improved\" frontline services, including action on fly-tipping.\n\n\nOne of the big local (and national) issues now in Ealing, and especially Southall, is fly-tipping, with the perception across the borough that the problem, while not new, has got significantly worse in recent years.\n\n\n# A quick recap of how we got here\n\n\nIn 2003, \"Filthy streets, dirty parks, a growing drug problem and overcrowding mark Southall as suffering 'inner-city deprivation'\", then [London Mayor Ken Livingstone admitted](https://www.ealingtimes.co.uk/news/54754.southalls-inner-city-deprivation/).\n\n\nAround the same time, Southallians [complained about rubbish and litter](https://web.archive.org/web/20040615012717/http://www.southallgasworks.com/Media/ConsultationReport.pdf) on our streets in response to a consultation on the possible development of the old Southall Gasworks site.\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-2021-08-03-19.47.15.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"287\" alt=\"Southall Gasworks consultation report from April 2003 outlines the perceived negative aspects of Southall in categories such as the environment, with particular reference to Rubbish/litter on streets.\">---\n\n\nIn 2010, soon after Peter Mason arrived in the borough, he was complaining about his new neighbours on Facebook, who - quite possibly - were rooting through his trash in the night:\n> \"How many times must i be woken up by their squeaking?\"\n\n\nRather than set an example and [report a noise nuisance](https://southallstories.uk/2026/01/22/its-never-enough-until-its/) via the council website like a normal person, Mason proposed a [callous, ruthless](https://southallstories.uk/2022/03/19/ealing-labour-leaks/) and deadly violent solution:\n> \"will somebody please shoot these fucking foxes in Acton!\"\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260211-184450.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"464\" alt=\"Peter Mason's Facebook post from 2010 expresses a plea to shoot these fucking foxes in Acton and a fantasy of a fox-hunt through Ealing.\">\n\n\n---\n\n\nIt was after Mason's arrival that Ealing Labour under ten leader Julian Bell made the \"difficult choice\" to freeze council tax every year while the national Tory government cut their funding by 60%. \n\n\nOf course, they wanted to protect the majority of people suffering under Tory and LibDem imposed national austerity from having to pay more council tax. But in doing so they reduced further still the amount of money available to sustain local services. \n\n\nCynics might point out that Bell was afraid that raising council tax would be vote loser. Instead, in order to retain power, he made the \"difficult choices\" to raise funds and save money by [selling off Ealing's public assets](https://southallstories.uk/2022/03/25/ealing-monopoly/) and cutting frontline services - including adult social care services in Southall, and a 50% reduction in waste collection across the borough. \n\n\nIn 2015, [residents protested](https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/neighbourly-care-southall-fights-back-9700892) against these cuts outside Ealing Town Hall. Peter Mason, always ready put put his spin on it, tweeted:\n\n\n> \"Some protesting wheelie bins, many more protesting adult social care [sic].

I feel so ashamed as a parent that I am raising my children in a place they know as home and that they find [disgusting](https://x.com/i/status/1510210792779567109) because of the state it's in.  \n\n\n[Many thanks again to the incredible LAGERcan volunteers who [cleaned up this particular fly-tip](https://x.com/i/status/1651945445554257921) the following year.]  \n\n\nLater that year, the Young Ealing Foundation published a report aiming to help [tackle youth violence in Southall](https://youngealingfoundation.org.uk/images/downloads/ealing/TACKLING-YOUTH-VIOLENCE-IN-SNG-22-1.pdf).  \n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260213-131156.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"461\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Key findings indicate that poor environmental appearance negatively affects young people, with many expressing feelings of neglect and a lack of care from authorities.\">\n\n---\n\nYoung people stated ‘Rubbish/pollution impacts mood’, ‘council don’t care about the environment, rubbish and unclean’ and ‘pollution, waste, and being dirty gives a negative impression.'  \n\n\nThe report stated that the poor physical appearance of the environment has a negative impact on young people.\n\n\nIn 2025, a disabled Southall Green neighbour, Arti, [described how her life is curtailed by fly-tipping](https://www.swlondoner.co.uk/news/02062025-southall-residents-demand-action-amid-fly-tipping-explosion)\n\n\n> Her mother is often forced to push her wheelchair into the road to get past due to pavements being frequently blocked by rubbish, leaving Arti exposed to speeding traffic. \n\n\n> [Arti] said: “It makes me anxious going out, and I’ve slowly, slowly cut down on going out due to this issue. \n\n\n> “It makes me really mentally unstable, and I feel trapped, because I can’t do anything about it. I’m trying my very best.”\n\n\nIt's a not uncommon sight here to see disabled people forced to risk their lives by walking with their mobility aids in the road because the pavements are impassable due to rubbish bags, mattresses, fridges, broken glass, illegally parked cars, and broken pavements.  \n\n\nAlso last year, my brilliant community pharmacist, Rahul Puri, explained the [serious public health harms](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfJ3fLA/) arising directly as a result of the dramatic rise of fly-tipping in Southall, an area already extremely vulnerable to [health problems](https://southallstories.uk/categories/health/) and stressors.\n\n\n# Fly-tipping doubled when weekly rubbish collections ended in 2016\n\n\n**Official government data shows the number of fly-tipping incidents doubled after 2016 and the introduction of fortnightly wheelie bin collections. Ealing Council's own numbers show it costs millions. And the solution they won't consider would save £1-1.6 million per year.**\n\n\nWhat actually happened is recorded in the government's own statistics: fly-tipping in Ealing doubled overnight and has cost council taxpayers millions every year since.  \n\nThree months after weekly collections ended, the council was already announcing a [fly-tipping crackdown](https://www.aroundealing.com/news/finding-and-fining-the-fly-tippers/). In November 2016, it reported that new taskforce crews had visited 763 streets and traced dumped waste back to 1,124 addresses in just three months. The message from cabinet member Bassam Mahfouz was simple: “We will find you and we will fine you.”  \n\n\nThe enforcement narrative was in place almost immediately after the service change - just as the official data shows fly-tipping doubling across the borough.It’s hard to escape the impression that the council knew the service change would create a problem and prepared to police the consequences rather than reconsider the policy itself.  \n\n\nSome might argue the rise could simply reflect better reporting rather than more fly-tipping. But the data shows a different pattern. Incidents were stable for years, then almost exactly doubled in the same year weekly collections ended - and have remained at that higher level ever since. Reporting changes usually produce short-term spikes or gradual trends. What Ealing’s figures show is a sudden, permanent step-change, which strongly suggests a real increase in dumping rather than just better record-keeping.\n\nEaling Council now spends **[£3 million annually](https://www.aroundealing.com/news/fly-tippers-pay-for-their-actions/)** clearing fly-tipping whilst claiming the problem is down to residents' behaviour. \n\n\nNow Ealing Southall's MP and formerly Peter Mason's deputy leader of the council, [Deirdre Costigan](https://youtu.be/E_NoNRlJasw) visited Southall Green in March 2022 to launch yet another ineffective authoritarian pre-election crackdown on fly-tipping. Costigan said, \"I'm here in Southall today with our fly-tip enforcement and clearing team to talk about our new zero tolerance approach to illegal dumping. Ealing is a brilliant place to live but a small minority of people spoil things for the rest of us by fly tipping in our borough.\" \n\n\nShe claimed that this small minority of people in Southall \"don't play by the rules\" and that their actions are \"disgusting, irresponsible and illegal.\" She also states that the council's CCTV surveillance and enforcement mechanisms are inadequate.\n\n\nBut the government data tells a different story: **Ealing Council created the problem, spent ten years managing the symptoms, and refuses to consider the solution because it would mean admitting the original policy was a catastrophic mistake.**\n\n\n# What the official data shows\n\n\nThe table below uses [Defra's national fly-tipping dataset](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-statistics-for-england), with population-adjusted rates per 1,000 residents to control for population growth.\n\n\n| Year | Total Incidents | Population | Incidents per 1,000 residents |\n|------|----------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| 2012–13 | 6,352 | 336,900 | 18.9 |\n| 2013–14 | 5,765 | 338,000 | 17.1 |\n| 2014–15 | 7,257 | 339,000 | 21.4 |\n| 2015–16 | 7,032 | 339,700 | 20.7 |\n| **2016–17** | **14,270** | **340,000** | **42.0** |\n| 2017–18 | 13,610 | 340,500 | 40.0 |\n| 2019–20 | 13,115 | 341,806 | 38.4 |\n| 2020–21 | 13,090 | 340,341 | 38.5 |\n| 2021–22 | 12,303 | 366,762 | 33.5 |\n| 2022–23 | 12,922 | 369,937 | 34.9 |\n| 2023–24 | 16,828 | 375,340 | 44.8 |\n\n\n**The pattern is undeniable:**\n\n\n- **Four years of stability** (2012–16): Fly-tipping averaged 17–21 incidents per 1,000 residents  \n- **One year of catastrophe** (2016–17): Jumped to 42 incidents per 1,000 residents  \n- **Eight years of plateau** (2017–24): Remained at 33–45 incidents per 1,000 residents  \n\n\n**That's a 137% increase per person** from 2012–13 to 2023–24.\n\n\nThis isn't explained by population growth. Even after adjusting for population, fly-tipping has more than doubled per resident.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The structural break\n\n\nFor data analysts, this is what a \"structural break\" looks like — a sudden, permanent shift in the underlying pattern that points to a specific policy change rather than gradual social trends.\n\n\n**Year-on-year changes show the exact moment:**\n\n\n- 2012–13 → 2013–14: -587 incidents (-9.2%)  \n- 2013–14 → 2014–15: +1,492 incidents (+25.9%)  \n- 2014–15 → 2015–16: -225 incidents (-3.1%)  \n\n\n**Then wheelie bins and fortnightly collections were introduced in June 2016:**\n\n\n- **2015–16 → 2016–17: +7,238 incidents (+102.9%)**\n\n\n**Followed by stabilisation at the new, much higher level:**\n\n\n- 2016–17 → 2017–18: -660 incidents (-4.6%)  \n- 2017–18 → 2019–20: -495 incidents (-3.6%)  \n- 2019–20 → 2020–21: -25 incidents (-0.2%)  \n- 2020–21 → 2021–22: -787 incidents (-6.0%)  \n- 2021–22 → 2022–23: +619 incidents (+5.0%)  \n- 2022–23 → 2023–24: +3,906 incidents (+30.2%)  \n\n\n---\n\n\n# What the council promised\n\n\nIn March 2016, Cabinet Member Bassam Mahfouz announced the switch to fortnightly collections and wheelie bins:\n\n\n> \"Wheelie bins will make it easier for people to recycle more meaning less waste will be sent to landfill, and they will also **keep our streets cleaner** by cutting down on the number of black bags ripped open by foxes.\"\n\n\nThe council claimed the changes would:\n- Save around £1.7 million per year  \n- Increase recycling rates  \n- Reduce street mess  \n- Improve cleanliness  \n\n\n---\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/file-00000000d0a87246a03e592b765cc8b8.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"A fox sniffs at garbage bags on the left pre-2016, while two rats are near massively overflowing wheelie bins on the right, post-2016.\">\n\n\n---\n\n\n# What actually happened\n\n\n**Fly-tipping per resident almost exactly doubled** in the year after the policy was introduced.\n\n\n**Streets got objectively dirtier** — by every measurable metric.\n\n\n**The rate has never returned to pre-2016 levels** — eight years later, fly-tipping remains approximately double what it was.\n\n\n**In 2023–24, the rate hit 44.8 per 1,000** — the highest on record, more than double the pre-2016 average.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**The residents who predicted the disaster have been proven right by eight years of data.**\n\n\n**The council that promised cleaner streets has delivered the opposite.**\n\n\nIf only the council actually [listened to the residents](https://open.substack.com/pub/southall/p/real-change-not-empty-consultations)!\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The timing problem for other explanations\n\n\nSome might blame the rise in fly-tipping on demographic change, population growth, or changing social attitudes.\n\n\nBut the data demolishes these explanations:\n\n\n**Demographic change happens gradually.** It doesn't produce a one-year doubling across an entire borough.\n\n\n**Population growth is accounted for.** These figures are per 1,000 residents — they already control for population increases.\n\n\n**Social trends develop slowly.** They don't create structural breaks where behaviour doubles in twelve months.\n\n\nThe data shows:\n- Stable pattern for years  \n- Sudden doubling in the exact year the waste collection system changed  \n- Permanent plateau at the new level  \n\n\n**That's the signature of a policy shock, not a social trend.**\n\nThe borough-wide collection frequency change is the only factor that aligns precisely with the timing and scale of the increase.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The false economy\n\n\nThe council claimed fortnightly collections would save £1.7 million per year, rising to £2.3 million.\n\n\n**But fly-tipping isn't free.**\n\n\n## The current annual cost\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260208-234604.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"848\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Ealing's enforcement activity report details monthly fly-tipping fines issued from January 2023, totaling 3,328 fines with an 11.09% issuance rate.\">\n\n\n---\n\n\nIn June 2025, Ealing Council admitted that **illegal dumping costs the borough £3 million a year.**\n\n\nThe council's own 2025 enforcement data shows:\n- 30,000 fly-tip reports  \n- 3,328 fines issued  \n- 11.09% enforcement rate  \n\n\n## Fine income vs clearance costs\n\n\nThe council issues fines of up to £1,000 for fly-tipping, but most enforcement uses Fixed Penalty Notices typically ranging from £400–£1,000.\n\n\n**Conservative estimate (£400 average fine):**\n- 3,328 fines × £400 = £1.33 million income  \n\n\n**Mid-range estimate (£600 average fine):**\n- 3,328 fines × £600 = £2.0 million income  \n\n\n**Net taxpayer cost:**\n\n\n| Category | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| Annual clearance costs | £3.0 million |\n| Fine income (low estimate) | £1.33 million |\n| Fine income (mid estimate) | £2.0 million |\n| **Net public cost** | **£1.0–£1.7 million per year** |\n\n\n## Cost per incident\n\n\nWith 16,828 incidents (2023–24) and £3 million annual cost:\n\n\n**£3,000,000 ÷ 16,828 = £178 per incident**\n\n\nThis covers collection labour, vehicles, disposal fees, investigation, enforcement, administration, and legal costs.\n\n\n## The 13-year comparison\n\n\n**Before wheelie bins (2012–16 average):**\n- Clearance costs: ~£430,000 annually  \n- Fine income: ~£149,000 annually  \n- **Net cost: ~£281,000 annually**  \n\n\n**After wheelie bins (2025):**\n- Clearance costs: £3,000,000 annually  \n- Fine income: £1,330,000–£2,000,000 annually  \n- **Net cost: £1,000,000–£1,700,000 annually**  \n\n\n**The increase:**\n- Clearance costs: **+£2.57 million annually** (+597%)  \n- Net taxpayer cost: **+£719,000–£1,420,000 annually** (+256–505%)  \n\n\n## The cumulative damage\n\n\nFrom 2016–17 to 2023–24, Ealing recorded **108,015 total fly-tipping incidents.**\n\n\nFrom 2012–13 to 2015–16, Ealing recorded **26,406 total incidents.**\n\n\n**That's 81,609 additional incidents over eight years** compared to pre-wheelie bin rates.\n\n\nEven at the conservative clearance cost of £178 per incident, that's **£14.5 million in additional fly-tipping costs** since the policy change.\n\n\n**The claimed £1.7 million annual savings?** \n\n\n**Wiped out more than eight times over.**\n\n\n---\n\n\n## The enforcement paradox\n\n\nYou might argue that enforcement has improved, so comparing to pre-2016 isn't fair.\n\n\n**The data proves this defence is worthless:**\n\n\n**2012–16 average:**\n- Fine recovery rate: ~34% of clearance costs  \n\n\n**2025:**\n- Fine recovery rate: ~44–67% of clearance costs  \n\n\n**So yes, enforcement has significantly improved.**\n\n\n**But the total volume has increased so much that even with better recovery rates, taxpayers now pay £1–1.7 million annually vs £281,000 pre-2016.**\n\n\nBetter enforcement of a much worse problem still costs far more than preventing the problem in the first place.\n\n\n**Ealing Labour's rubbish collection scheme doubled fly-tipping and cost eight times more to clean up the mess they created than they saved by stopping weekly waste removal**\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The perverse incentive\n\n\nHere's where it gets darkly absurd.\n\n\nIf the council actually collected the maximum £1,000 fine for all 3,328 enforcement actions:\n\n\n**Fine income: £3,328,000**  \n**Clearance costs: £3,000,000**  \n**Net profit: £328,000**\n\n\n**The council would be making money from fly-tipping.**\n\n\nNow, they're not actually collecting £1,000 per fine — most are Fixed Penalty Notices at lower amounts, and many go unpaid. But the theoretical possibility exists.\n\n\n**And that creates a perverse incentive:**\n\n\nThe more fly-tipping occurs, the more enforcement opportunities exist, the more fine income potentially flows in.\n\n\n**It's like something out of Catch-22.**\n\n\nMilo Minderbinder would be proud: create a problem through policy change, establish an enforcement regime, generate revenue from the problem you created, claim you're \"tackling\" the issue whilst financially benefiting from its continuation.\n\n\n**Everyone in the syndicate gets richer — except the residents whose streets are covered in rubbish and who are paying for enforcement through their council tax.**\n\n\n# The children's centres connection\n\n\nIn 2023–24, Ealing Council began consulting on closing 10 of the borough's 25 [children's centres](https://southallstories.uk/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local/), claiming budget pressures.\n\n\nThe projected savings? Around £1 million annually.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the council:\n- Spends £3 million clearing fly-tipping (a problem they created)  \n- Spends £1.9 million on enforcement  \n- Could save £1–1.6 million by returning to weekly collections\n- But won't, because it would mean admitting the 2016 policy failed  \n\n\n**So let's get this straight:**\n\n\n**Can't afford:** £1 million to keep children's centres open for vulnerable families  \n**Can afford:** £3 million clearing fly-tipping + £1.9 million enforcement, both addressing a problem the council created and refuses to fix  \n**Could save:** £1–1.6 million annually by reversing the policy that caused the problem  \n**But won't:** Because political pride is apparently worth more than children's services  \n\n\nAll while justifying [massive pay rises for ineffective and wasteful councillors](https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&spage=common/eacouncil220.htm) that cost over a million pounds in four years. That's enough to pay for all the children's centres. \n\n\n# The Milo Minderbinder business model\n\n\nIf you're not familiar with Catch-22, Milo Minderbinder is the mess officer who runs a syndicate that profits from the war by trading with both sides, eventually bombing his own base because the Germans paid him to do it. Everyone is a member of the syndicate, so everyone benefits. Some more than others.\n\n\n**Ealing's version:**\n\n\n1. **Create the problem:** Switch to fortnightly collections (save £1.7m)  \n2. **Problem doubles:** Fly-tipping increases 100%  \n3. **Monetise the problem:** Enforcement regime generates fine income  \n4. **Claim success:** \"55% reduction in target areas! We're cracking down!\"  \n5. **Never fix the root cause:** Because the enforcement regime is now part of the budget model  \n6. **Close children's centres:** Can't afford services, must \"manage budget pressures\"  \n7. **Everyone in the syndicate benefits:** Except residents living with the rubbish and paying council tax for both the clearance and the enforcement  \n\n\n**We just need to dump enough rubbish to earn enough money to keep the children's centres open!**\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260210-215538.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"960\" alt=\"Former Ealing Council leader Julian Bell in brand new spotlessly clean high-visibility clothing is pulling a wheelie bin full of cash along a residential street, with a tweet discussing recycling targets and saving £2.2m.\">_Former Ealing Council leader Julian Bell in brand new spotlessly clean high-visibility clothing is pulling a wheelie bin full of cash?_\n---\n\nMilo would absolutely pitch this:\n\n\n> \"See, it's really quite simple. We save money by collecting rubbish less frequently. This creates more fly-tipping. We then fine people for fly-tipping. The fines pay for enforcement. The enforcement creates more fines. Eventually, if we get enough rubbish on the streets, we'll be making a profit! Then we can afford frontline services again. Everyone benefits from the syndicate.\"\n\n\n**The only flaw in the plan:** You have to live in a borough covered in fly-tipped rubbish whilst paying council tax for both the clearance and enforcement of a problem your council created and profits from.\n\n\nBut hey, **bangarang, Pete. The syndicate thanks you for your service.**. \n\n\n# The solution they won't consider\n\nIn January 2026, Council Leader [Peter Mason](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1ZcEq2oPo2/) appeared on BBC Politics London to discuss the council's fly-tipping enforcement campaign.\n\nOn [LinkedIn, he boasted](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peter-mason-5a377941_i-was-on-bbc-politics-london-this-morning-activity-7403388834643857408-VXEM):\n\n> \"We've been running a campaign across Ealing this year aimed at changing behaviour: to increase resident awareness and reporting, and to crack down on fly tips. It's working.\n>\n> - 55% decrease in fly tips in our target areas\n> - Increased our maximum fine to £1,000\n> - Issued almost 2,000 fixed penalty notices in the last 6 months alone\n> - Deployed extra CCTV cameras, which have identified 20 persistent criminal waster vehicles that we are now going after\n> - Naming and Shaming on our website leading to positive identifications\"\n\nHe concluded: **\"Bangarang.\"**\n\nBangarang indeed.  \n\n\n**Here's the obvious question Peter Mason won't answer:**\n\n\n**If enforcement campaigns can achieve 55% reduction in target areas at a cost of £1.9 million, why not reverse the policy that caused the 100% increase everywhere?**\n\n\n## The economic comparison\n\n\n**Current approach (2026 budget):**\n\n\n| Category | Annual Cost |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Enforcement budget | £1,910,000 |\n| Clearance costs | £3,000,000 |\n| Fine income | -£1,330,000 to -£2,000,000 |\n| **Net cost to taxpayers** | **£2,910,000–£3,580,000** |\n\n\n**Achievement:** 55% reduction in target areas only (not borough-wide)  \n**Cost per prevented incident:** ~£868  \n\n\n---\n\n\n**Return to weekly collections (estimated):**\n\n\n| Category | Annual Cost |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Additional collection cost vs fortnightly | £1,700,000 |\n| Clearance (at 2012–16 levels) | £430,000 |\n| Fine income (at 2012–16 levels) | -£149,000 |\n| **Net cost to taxpayers** | **£1,981,000** |\n\n\n**Expected result:** Return to pre-2016 baseline (~7,000 incidents vs current ~16,000)  \n**Cost per prevented incident:** ~£189  \n\n\n---\n\n\n**Annual saving from weekly collections: £929,000–£1,599,000**\n\n\n**Service improvement is 4.6 times more cost-effective than enforcement.**\n\n\n## The full comparison\n\n\n| Metric | Pre-2016 (Weekly) | 2025–26 (Fortnightly + Enforcement) | Return to Weekly (Estimated) |\n|--------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Collection frequency** | Weekly | Fortnightly | Weekly |\n| **Annual incidents** | ~7,000 | ~16,000 | ~7,000 |\n| **Incidents per 1,000** | ~21 | ~40–45 | ~21 |\n| **Clearance cost** | ~£430k | £3,000k | ~£430k |\n| **Enforcement cost** | Minimal | £1,910k | Minimal |\n| **Fine income** | ~-£149k | -£1,330k to -£2,000k | ~-£149k |\n| **Net taxpayer cost** | ~£281k | £2,910k–£3,580k | ~£1,981k |\n| **Cost per prevented incident** | N/A (baseline) | £868 (target areas) | £189 (borough-wide) |\n| **Annual saving vs current** | N/A | N/A | **£929k–£1,599k** |\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Preventing the problem vs managing the symptoms\n\n\n**Weekly collections:**\n- Cost: £1.7 million more than fortnightly  \n- Benefit: Prevents ~9,000 fly-tipping incidents  \n- Net effect: Saves £0.9–1.6 million annually vs current approach  \n- Addresses: Root cause  \n\n\n**Current enforcement:**\n- Cost: £1.9 million in enforcement alone  \n- Benefit: 55% reduction in target areas only  \n- Net effect: Costs £0.9–1.6 million more annually than prevention  \n- Addresses: Symptoms whilst cause continues  \n\n\n**Put simply:**\n\n\n**Preventing the problem would cost £1–1.6 million less per year than managing it.**\n\n\nBut that would require admitting the 2016 policy was a mistake.\n\n\nAnd apparently, protecting political face is worth £1–1.6 million of taxpayers' money annually.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The pattern\n\n\nThis fits Ealing Council's broader modus operandi:\n\n\n**1. Policy imposed without genuine consultation**  \nOver 7,000 residents signed a petition against wheelie bins. The council ignored them and implemented the policy anyway.\n\n\n**2. Environmental rhetoric masking cost-cutting**  \nPromised \"cleaner streets\" whilst implementing cost-saving measures that created the opposite outcome.\n\n\n\n**3. Costs externalised onto residents**  \nFortnightly collections create storage problems in terraced housing, HMOs and all the new tower blocks (Southall's predominant housing types). Residents bear the burden whilst council claims savings.\n\n\n**4. Claims contradicted by measurable outcomes**  \nPromised streets would be \"cleaner.\" Data shows fly-tipping doubled and remained at that level for eight years.\n\n\n**5. Blame shifted to residents**  \nWhen policy causes problem, council blames \"behaviour\" and \"awareness\" rather than examining whether the policy itself failed.\n\n\n**6. Expensive symptom management instead of admitting failure**  \nSpend £1.9 million on enforcement rather than £1.7 million on service improvement, because the latter would require admitting the original policy was wrong.\n\n\n**7. No outcomes evaluation**  \nReport activity statistics (investigations, fines, warnings) without ever asking: \"Did the policy we implemented in 2016 cause the doubling? Should we reverse it?\"\n\n\n---\n\n\n# What this proves\n\n\n**1. The data is undeniable**  \nFly-tipping per resident almost exactly doubled in the year after fortnightly collections were introduced. No other borough-wide change explains the timing or scale.\n\n\n**2. The cost is substantial**  \n£14.5 million in additional clearance costs over eight years, plus £1.9 million annual enforcement spending, far exceeds the claimed £1.7 million annual savings.\n\n\n**3. The solution is obvious**  \nReturn to weekly collections. It would be cheaper, more effective, and address the root cause rather than managing symptoms.\n\n\n**4. The political calculation is clear**  \nThe council prioritises avoiding admission of policy failure over fiscal responsibility and effectiveness.\n\n\n**5. Residents were right all along**  \nThe 7,000+ people who opposed wheelie bins, the residents who predicted fly-tipping would increase, the community members who've complained for eight years — they were all correct.\n\n\n**6. The council's approach to evidence**  \nWhen data contradicts promises, ignore the data, blame residents, and spend millions managing the problem you created rather than reversing the policy that caused it.\n\n\n---\n# Where are we now?\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/yvyt-southall-flyer.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"764\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: An advertisement encourages community members to submit ideas to improve Southall, featuring images of people shopping and sitting, and provides a QR code and website for more information.\">\n\n\n---\n\n\nNow, if anyone has any bright ideas about how to make Southall cleaner and more pleasant, the mega rich developers building more than ten thousand new homes in tens of new tower blocks have kindly given us **£120,000** from their profits to make the place more marketable for their sales teams.\n\n\nPlease get your thinking caps on and submit your applications to the [Southall Town Team](https://dosomethinggood.ealing.gov.uk/your-voice-your-town/southall-town-team/)led by [Jags Sanghera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jags-sanghera-04722153)... oh, wait, I feel another story coming on!\n\n---\n\n\n## Methodology note\n\n\nAll data sourced from:\n- **Defra Fly-tipping Statistics 2012–13 to 2023–24** (official government dataset)  \n- **ONS Mid-Year Population Estimates for Ealing** (2012–2018)  \n- Population estimates for 2019–2024 included in Defra dataset  \n- **Ealing Council enforcement data** (2025, published on council website)  \n- **Ealing Council statements** (2016 cabinet announcements, 2025 media coverage)  \n- Per capita calculations use ONS mid-year population estimates for each year to control for population growth.   \n\n_Caveats_:\n- Data crunched with the help of AI. I checked the headline data, but if you see any mistakes, human or otherwise, please let me know.  \n- There could be other causes of the increase in fly-tipping. The data clearly shows a doubling of fly-tipping incidents immediately after weekly refuse collections were replaced with fortnightly general waste collections.  \n- As a friend said to me, we need more bins, more collections, free disposal of bulky waste and recycling items, targeting of illegal dumping by organised rogue waste disposal and clearance companies and unscrupulous HMO landlords, and more education and support about what's acceptable waste disposal and what isn't.  \n- Enfield Council switched from weekly to fortnightly bin collections in 2019. The data from Enfield doesn't show the same dramatic shift as it does in Ealing, but residents there are complaining of [increased fly-tipping](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/residents-left-fuming-after-changes-32662715) and asking for a return of weekly collections.\n",

The fire occurred exactly as the evidence suggested it would.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t believe council investigators are universally incompetent. Some may be excellent at their jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>That leaves the third option.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"what-investigation-actually-means\">What &ldquo;Investigation&rdquo; Actually Means</h1>\n<p>The year-long investigation wasn&rsquo;t designed to establish whether harmful practices were occurring. It was designed to establish whether those practices met the specific legal threshold of &ldquo;statutory nuisance&rdquo; sufficient to trigger enforcement action.</p>\n<p>These are not the same thing.</p>\n<p>Harmful practices can continue indefinitely without meeting statutory nuisance thresholds, particularly when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investigation methodologies require direct witnessing at specific moments</li>\n<li>Odour assessments depend on subjective officer judgment at time of visit</li>\n<li>Chemical monitoring is time-limited and may miss peak exposures</li>\n<li>Regulatory frameworks create jurisdictional confusion</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Best practice&rdquo; letters substitute for enforcement action</li>\n<li>Complaints are acknowledged but not acted upon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result is a system that generates impressive paperwork - year-long investigations! Daily monitoring! Coordination between departments! - while ensuring harmful activities continue until catastrophic failure forces intervention.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-pattern-across-southall\">The Pattern Across Southall</h1>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t unique to Johnson Street. It&rsquo;s the same pattern documented across multiple pollution cases in Southall:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p><strong>FM Conway</strong>: Dr John Freeman, council&rsquo;s former air quality officer, admitted at a September 2018 Air Quality Scrutiny Panel meeting there had been a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2019/08/25/southall-under-siege-the-neighbours/\">lack of scrutiny</a>&rdquo; of this operator. Despite &ldquo;a considerable body of complaints,&rdquo; enforcement remained elusive.</p>\n<p><strong>Southall Gasworks</strong>: Between 2017-2020, residents reported severe respiratory symptoms, hospitalisations, and toxic odours. Public Health England eventually acknowledged naphthalene levels required &ldquo;urgent reduction&rdquo; - but only after I pointed out at a public meeting that localised readings were consistently above legal limits, contrary to the &ldquo;site averages&rdquo; PHE had presented suggesting no harm.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&mdash; My son was hospitalised three times with asthma in 2016-2017 when gasworks remediation began. The headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School reported to governors that &ldquo;<a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2018/09/11/berkeleys-school-governors-board-member/\">very strong smells from the gasworks site caused asthma and headaches</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>PHE&rsquo;s final position: no physical harm occurred, though they acknowledged some residents experienced anxiety about exposure (implying psychological rather than toxicological harm). This despite later admitting naphthalene levels exceeded safety thresholds when examined at neighbourhood level rather than site-wide averages.</p>\n<p><strong>Johnson Street</strong>: Year-long investigation finding no evidence of problems. Site continues operating. Fire occurs exactly as residents predicted.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-class-and-race-context\">The Class and Race Context</h1>\n<p>In my formal complaint, I drew comparison with Council Leader Peter Mason&rsquo;s response to different pollution incidents:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;My reason for sharing Peter Mason&rsquo;s breathless twittering about the poisoning of the Brent River was not for you [&hellip;] to do anything about it, but simply to highlight the disparity between how people in Southall are treated when we complain about poison air from Mason&rsquo;s MIPIM party sponsors, and how eels are treated by our new council leader and Southall Green ward councillor.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>When eels in the River Brent faced toxic exposure, Mason tweeted demanding immediate enforcement action against &ldquo;disgusting and depressing&rdquo; pollution.</p>\n<p>When predominantly Black and Asian residents of Southall reported toxic air exposure, hospitalised children, and explicit fire risks, the same council leader consistently stated <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18503/open_letter_to_cash_from_cllr_peter_mason_leader_of_ealing_council_november_2022.pdf\">no enforcement action can be taken</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t accidental. As I noted in my complaint (and in my formal and comprehensive <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2023/01/26/response-to-ealings-air-quality/\">response</a> to Ealing&rsquo;s air quality strategy consultation - which was, of course, unacknowledged and ignored):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;It is now widely acknowledged that BAME people are more likely to suffer the ill-effects of air pollution, so this should be treated as a potential health emergency, particularly by a council which has such a poor record with equalities as highlighted so profoundly by <a href=\"https://erec.dosomethinggood.org.uk/wp-content/themes/wp-bootstrap-starter-child/downloads/ealing-race-equality-commission-final-report-27-january-2022.pdf\">Lord Woolley&rsquo;s Race Equality Commission Report</a> last year.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In 2022, Lord Woolley&rsquo;s Race Equality Commission warned that race inequality was “a crisis demanding urgent response” and explicitly called for a public health approach to structural harm, stronger community trust, and real accountability.</p>\n<p>Yet when toxic smoke from the Johnson Street recycling yard fire spread through a predominantly BAME residential area, the council response followed the same old institutional pattern: delay, fragmentation, minimal enforcement and no visible precautionary public health intervention.</p>\n<p>The gap between Ealing’s commitments and its actions is not abstract. It is measurable in hours of smoke exposure, unanswered resident concerns, and a regulatory system that still reacts procedurally and defensively, instead of protecting communities proactively, or indeed collaboratively.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/asthma-london-air-pollution-research-ulez-expansion-b1086318.html\">Southall has nearly a quarter (23%) of the top 30 GP practices in London where asthma treatment is most prevalent</a>. The community is characterised by high asthma rates, prolonged exposure to cumulative industrial and transport pollution, poverty, and predominantly Black and Asian residents.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>When harmful environmental practices occur in such communities, investigation methodologies that consistently fail to verify harm don&rsquo;t operate neutrally. They operate to enable continued harm in places where residents' testimony is systematically discounted.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-gove-letter\">The Gove Letter</h1>\n<p>In my August 2023 email, I included a quote from then-Housing Secretary <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1179075/SoS_letter_to_Ealing_Council.pdf\">Michael Gove&rsquo;s letter</a> to Ealing Council&rsquo;s Chief Executive Tony Clements regarding a separate failure:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;You have failed your resident. Everyone, particularly those who are vulnerable, should be able to expect to have their complaint taken seriously.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gove noted this indicated &ldquo;wider organisational culture at the council.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Johnson Street fire - occurring 30 months after explicit written warnings, photographic evidence, and formal complaints that went unacknowledged - proves he was right about that culture.</p>\n<h1 id=\"why-best-practice-letters-dont-work\">Why &ldquo;Best Practice&rdquo; Letters Don&rsquo;t Work</h1>\n<p>The council&rsquo;s response to resident concerns was to write to businesses requesting they &ldquo;explore what additional best practicable means could be taken to reduce potential impact.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But as the council itself acknowledged: <strong>&ldquo;This can only be a request from the Council. Since it is not the statutory regulator in this context the Council cannot require action to be taken.&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>Translation: We asked them nicely. We have no power to make them comply. Operations will continue unchanged.</p>\n<p>When I requested a copy of this letter to see what &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; were actually recommended, I received no response.</p>\n<p>The letter, if it existed, had no enforcement mechanism. It was administrative theatre - sufficient to claim the council had &ldquo;acted&rdquo; on complaints, insufficient to change any actual practices.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-investigation-should-look-like\">What Investigation Should Look Like</h1>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>I suggested this to the council in November 2022:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Instead of &lsquo;reacting&rsquo; in response to residents' complaints, perhaps try &lsquo;proacting&rsquo; and working with us - it could save you a lot of time, effort and money. For example, the Environmental Protection Officer could join the CASH WhatsApp group, or set up a dedicated WhatsApp group for residents to report, investigate and &lsquo;verify&rsquo; odours?&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No response. No adoption of this suggestion.</p>\n<p>Why not? Because the purpose of investigation isn&rsquo;t to verify what residents report - it&rsquo;s to apply methodologies that consistently fail to meet statutory nuisance thresholds while generating paperwork demonstrating the council &ldquo;took concerns seriously.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Genuine investigation would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept resident photographic/video evidence as valid documentation</li>\n<li>Coordinate with residents to target site visits when problems occur</li>\n<li>Treat pattern of complaints as evidence even without direct witnessing</li>\n<li>Apply precautionary principle when fire risk is explicitly identified</li>\n<li>Suspend operations pending safety review when evidence warrants</li>\n<li>Respond to formal complaints within policy timescales</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of this occurred.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-question-we-should-be-asking\">The Question We Should Be Asking</h1>\n<p>So the answer to &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t anyone from the council check it out?&rdquo; is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>They did. They conducted a year-long investigation. They made site visits. They reviewed concerns. They coordinated across departments. They generated reports. They denied responsibility. And then they determined that no action was required.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The better question is: <strong>Why do investigation methodologies consistently fail to verify harm that residents can document, predict, and experience - until catastrophic failure proves residents were right all along?</strong></p>\n<p>That question exposes something more troubling than neglect.</p>\n<p>It exposes systems designed to manage complaints rather than address harm.</p>\n<p>It exposes regulatory frameworks that prioritise operational continuity over precautionary protection.</p>\n<p>It exposes methodologies that require perfect evidence at the perfect moment, while rejecting pattern evidence from residents whose daily lives give them vastly more observation time than occasional site visits.</p>\n<p>It exposes jurisdictional confusion that functions as liability shield, with each authority claiming another holds responsibility until harm escalates beyond deniability.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-accountability-gap\">The Accountability Gap</h1>\n<p>The fire occurred exactly as residents predicted in explicit written warnings submitted 30 months prior, accompanied by photographic evidence, video documentation, and formal complaints.The council conducted a year-long investigation and found no evidence requiring enforcement action.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>One of these accounts is accurate. Both cannot be.</p>\n<p>Either residents fabricated evidence of problems that didn&rsquo;t exist, or investigation methodologies are designed to avoid verifying harm that does exist.</p>\n<p>The fire proves which account is accurate.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-this-means\">What This Means</h1>\n<p>The Johnson Street fire should not be investigated as an isolated incident of unknown cause. It should be investigated as the predictable endpoint of regulatory culture that prioritises paperwork over precaution.</p>\n<p>The investigation should examine:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Why year-long daily monitoring failed to verify harm residents documented in three visits</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Why photographic and video evidence was insufficient to trigger enforcement action</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Why explicit fire risk warnings in formal complaints went unacknowledged</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Why &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; letters with no enforcement mechanism substitute for operational suspension when evidence warrants</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Why jurisdictional confusion between council and Environment Agency persists across multiple cases</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Why complaint policy breaches occurred when formal escalation was attempted</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Whether investigation methodologies are designed to verify harm or to avoid triggering enforcement thresholds</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any investigation that treats this fire as unforeseeable - when residents literally foresaw it and documented the prediction - will miss the essential truth.</p>\n<p><strong>This fire happened not despite investigation, but because of how investigation operates when applied to communities whose warnings are systematically discounted.</strong></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>The council checked it out. They spent a year checking it out. That&rsquo;s what makes this worse.</p>\n<p>Because it means the fire occurred not through ignorance, but through choice: the choice to conduct investigations in ways that consistently fail to verify harm, to accept jurisdictional confusion as operational framework, to substitute &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; letters for enforcement action, and to leave formal complaints unacknowledged until catastrophic failure forces temporary intervention.</p>\n<p>They checked it out. They found nothing. And then exactly what residents warned about came true.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not regulatory failure. <strong>That&rsquo;s regulatory function.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The full correspondence documenting this timeline is available through Freedom of Information requests to Ealing Council.

The burning plastic odours I and my neighbours experienced were imagined.\n\n\n2. **Council investigators are incompetent.** \n\n\nDespite being trained Environmental Health Officers, despite having dedicated resources, despite a year of daily monitoring, they genuinely couldn't detect what untrained residents could document in hours.\n\n\n3. **Investigation techniques are designed not to verify harm.** \n\n\nAs I suggested in my August 2023 email: if investigators could verify what residents report, they would have to take enforcement action. Better to conduct investigations in ways that consistently fail to establish statutory nuisance thresholds.\n\n\nI don't believe I fabricated evidence. My photographs exist. The fire occurred exactly as the evidence suggested it would.\n\n\nI don't believe council investigators are universally incompetent. Some may be excellent at their jobs.\n\n\n**That leaves the third option.**\n\n\n# What \"Investigation\" Actually Means\n\n\nThe year-long investigation wasn't designed to establish whether harmful practices were occurring. It was designed to establish whether those practices met the specific legal threshold of \"statutory nuisance\" sufficient to trigger enforcement action.\n\n\nThese are not the same thing.\n\n\nHarmful practices can continue indefinitely without meeting statutory nuisance thresholds, particularly when:\n- Investigation methodologies require direct witnessing at specific moments\n- Odour assessments depend on subjective officer judgment at time of visit\n- Chemical monitoring is time-limited and may miss peak exposures\n- Regulatory frameworks create jurisdictional confusion\n- \"Best practice\" letters substitute for enforcement action\n- Complaints are acknowledged but not acted upon\n\n\nThe result is a system that generates impressive paperwork - year-long investigations! Daily monitoring! Coordination between departments! - while ensuring harmful activities continue until catastrophic failure forces intervention.\n\n\n# The Pattern Across Southall\n\n\nThis isn't unique to Johnson Street. It's the same pattern documented across multiple pollution cases in Southall:\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260115-234838-collage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Text snippets highlight concerns about air quality reports and legal limits for pollutants.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\n**FM Conway**: Dr John Freeman, council's former air quality officer, admitted at a September 2018 Air Quality Scrutiny Panel meeting there had been a \"[lack of scrutiny](https://southallstories.uk/2019/08/25/southall-under-siege-the-neighbours/)\" of this operator. Despite \"a considerable body of complaints,\" enforcement remained elusive.\n\n\n**Southall Gasworks**: Between 2017-2020, residents reported severe respiratory symptoms, hospitalisations, and toxic odours. Public Health England eventually acknowledged naphthalene levels required \"urgent reduction\" - but only after I pointed out at a public meeting that localised readings were consistently above legal limits, contrary to the \"site averages\" PHE had presented suggesting no harm.\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260120-133809.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"282\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Public Health England's report states that current naphthalene levels aren't immediately risky but should be reduced to prevent long-term exposure.\">\n\n\n--- My son was hospitalised three times with asthma in 2016-2017 when gasworks remediation began. The headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School reported to governors that \"[very strong smells from the gasworks site caused asthma and headaches](https://southallstories.uk/2018/09/11/berkeleys-school-governors-board-member/).\"\n\n\nPHE's final position: no physical harm occurred, though they acknowledged some residents experienced anxiety about exposure (implying psychological rather than toxicological harm). This despite later admitting naphthalene levels exceeded safety thresholds when examined at neighbourhood level rather than site-wide averages.\n\n\n**Johnson Street**: Year-long investigation finding no evidence of problems. Site continues operating. Fire occurs exactly as residents predicted.\n\n\n# The Class and Race Context\n\n\nIn my formal complaint, I drew comparison with Council Leader Peter Mason's response to different pollution incidents:\n\n\n> \"My reason for sharing Peter Mason's breathless twittering about the poisoning of the Brent River was not for you [...] to do anything about it, but simply to highlight the disparity between how people in Southall are treated when we complain about poison air from Mason's MIPIM party sponsors, and how eels are treated by our new council leader and Southall Green ward councillor.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260120-134846.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"532\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Twitter exchange criticizes Thames Water for dumping sewage into the River Brent, calling for enforcement action from the Environment Agency.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\nWhen eels in the River Brent faced toxic exposure, Mason tweeted demanding immediate enforcement action against \"disgusting and depressing\" pollution.\n\n\nWhen predominantly Black and Asian residents of Southall reported toxic air exposure, hospitalised children, and explicit fire risks, the same council leader consistently stated [no enforcement action can be taken](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18503/open_letter_to_cash_from_cllr_peter_mason_leader_of_ealing_council_november_2022.pdf).\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260120-134910.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"955\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet thread by Peter Mason discusses a meeting about air quality and pollution, highlighting the importance of accountability and the ongoing need for change.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\nThis isn't accidental. As I noted in my complaint (and in my formal and comprehensive [response](https://southallstories.uk/2023/01/26/response-to-ealings-air-quality/) to Ealing's air quality strategy consultation - which was, of course, unacknowledged and ignored):\n\n\n> \"It is now widely acknowledged that BAME people are more likely to suffer the ill-effects of air pollution, so this should be treated as a potential health emergency, particularly by a council which has such a poor record with equalities as highlighted so profoundly by [Lord Woolley's Race Equality Commission Report](https://erec.dosomethinggood.org.uk/wp-content/themes/wp-bootstrap-starter-child/downloads/ealing-race-equality-commission-final-report-27-january-2022.pdf) last year.\"\n\n\nIn 2022, Lord Woolley's Race Equality Commission warned that race inequality was “a crisis demanding urgent response” and explicitly called for a public health approach to structural harm, stronger community trust, and real accountability. \n\n\nYet when toxic smoke from the Johnson Street recycling yard fire spread through a predominantly BAME residential area, the council response followed the same old institutional pattern: delay, fragmentation, minimal enforcement and no visible precautionary public health intervention.\n\n\nThe gap between Ealing’s commitments and its actions is not abstract. It is measurable in hours of smoke exposure, unanswered resident concerns, and a regulatory system that still reacts procedurally and defensively, instead of protecting communities proactively, or indeed collaboratively.\n\n\n[Southall has nearly a quarter (23%) of the top 30 GP practices in London where asthma treatment is most prevalent](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/asthma-london-air-pollution-research-ulez-expansion-b1086318.html). The community is characterised by high asthma rates, prolonged exposure to cumulative industrial and transport pollution, poverty, and predominantly Black and Asian residents.\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260115-235004-collage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Scattered documents with text addressing council proposals and data requests are overlain on a textured background.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\nWhen harmful environmental practices occur in such communities, investigation methodologies that consistently fail to verify harm don't operate neutrally. They operate to enable continued harm in places where residents' testimony is systematically discounted.\n\n\n# The Gove Letter\n\n\nIn my August 2023 email, I included a quote from then-Housing Secretary [Michael Gove's letter](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1179075/SoS_letter_to_Ealing_Council.pdf) to Ealing Council's Chief Executive Tony Clements regarding a separate failure:\n\n\n> \"You have failed your resident. Everyone, particularly those who are vulnerable, should be able to expect to have their complaint taken seriously.\"\n\n\nGove noted this indicated \"wider organisational culture at the council.\"\n\n\nThe Johnson Street fire - occurring 30 months after explicit written warnings, photographic evidence, and formal complaints that went unacknowledged - proves he was right about that culture.\n\n\n# Why \"Best Practice\" Letters Don't Work\n\n\nThe council's response to resident concerns was to write to businesses requesting they \"explore what additional best practicable means could be taken to reduce potential impact.\"\n\n\nBut as the council itself acknowledged: **\"This can only be a request from the Council. Since it is not the statutory regulator in this context the Council cannot require action to be taken.\"**\n\n\nTranslation: We asked them nicely. We have no power to make them comply. Operations will continue unchanged.\n\n\nWhen I requested a copy of this letter to see what \"best practices\" were actually recommended, I received no response.\n\n\nThe letter, if it existed, had no enforcement mechanism. It was administrative theatre - sufficient to claim the council had \"acted\" on complaints, insufficient to change any actual practices.\n\n\n# What Investigation Should Look Like\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260115-234559-collage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: The image displays several paragraphs of typed text, with paragraph numbers 10, 11, 12, and 13 visible, discussing environmental and agency-related topics.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\nI suggested this to the council in November 2022:\n\n\n> \"Instead of 'reacting' in response to residents' complaints, perhaps try 'proacting' and working with us - it could save you a lot of time, effort and money. For example, the Environmental Protection Officer could join the CASH WhatsApp group, or set up a dedicated WhatsApp group for residents to report, investigate and 'verify' odours?\"\n\n\nNo response. No adoption of this suggestion.\n\n\nWhy not? Because the purpose of investigation isn't to verify what residents report - it's to apply methodologies that consistently fail to meet statutory nuisance thresholds while generating paperwork demonstrating the council \"took concerns seriously.\"\n\n\nGenuine investigation would:\n- Accept resident photographic/video evidence as valid documentation\n- Coordinate with residents to target site visits when problems occur\n- Treat pattern of complaints as evidence even without direct witnessing\n- Apply precautionary principle when fire risk is explicitly identified\n- Suspend operations pending safety review when evidence warrants\n- Respond to formal complaints within policy timescales\n\n\nNone of this occurred.\n\n\n# The Question We Should Be Asking\n\n\nSo the answer to \"Why didn't anyone from the council check it out?\" is:\n\n\n> **They did. They conducted a year-long investigation. They made site visits. They reviewed concerns. They coordinated across departments. They generated reports. They denied responsibility. And then they determined that no action was required.**\n\n\nThe better question is: **Why do investigation methodologies consistently fail to verify harm that residents can document, predict, and experience - until catastrophic failure proves residents were right all along?**\n\n\nThat question exposes something more troubling than neglect.\n\n\nIt exposes systems designed to manage complaints rather than address harm.\n\n\nIt exposes regulatory frameworks that prioritise operational continuity over precautionary protection.\n\n\nIt exposes methodologies that require perfect evidence at the perfect moment, while rejecting pattern evidence from residents whose daily lives give them vastly more observation time than occasional site visits.\n\n\nIt exposes jurisdictional confusion that functions as liability shield, with each authority claiming another holds responsibility until harm escalates beyond deniability.\n\n\n# The Accountability Gap\n\nThe fire occurred exactly as residents predicted in explicit written warnings submitted 30 months prior, accompanied by photographic evidence, video documentation, and formal complaints.The council conducted a year-long investigation and found no evidence requiring enforcement action.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260115-235211-collage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A collage of document snippets features partial text about failed complaints and a poisoning investigation.\">\n\n--- \n\nOne of these accounts is accurate. Both cannot be.\n\nEither residents fabricated evidence of problems that didn't exist, or investigation methodologies are designed to avoid verifying harm that does exist.\n\nThe fire proves which account is accurate.\n\n# What This Means\n\nThe Johnson Street fire should not be investigated as an isolated incident of unknown cause. It should be investigated as the predictable endpoint of regulatory culture that prioritises paperwork over precaution.\n\nThe investigation should examine:\n1. **Why year-long daily monitoring failed to verify harm residents documented in three visits**\n2. **Why photographic and video evidence was insufficient to trigger enforcement action**\n3. **Why explicit fire risk warnings in formal complaints went unacknowledged**\n4. **Why \"best practice\" letters with no enforcement mechanism substitute for operational suspension when evidence warrants**\n5. **Why jurisdictional confusion between council and Environment Agency persists across multiple cases**\n6. **Why complaint policy breaches occurred when formal escalation was attempted**\n7. **Whether investigation methodologies are designed to verify harm or to avoid triggering enforcement thresholds**\n\nAny investigation that treats this fire as unforeseeable - when residents literally foresaw it and documented the prediction - will miss the essential truth.\n\n**This fire happened not despite investigation, but because of how investigation operates when applied to communities whose warnings are systematically discounted.**\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260115-234021-collage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A partially visible email discusses waste incinerators and regulators, involving the Environment Agency.\">\n\n--- \n\nThe council checked it out. They spent a year checking it out. That's what makes this worse.\n\nBecause it means the fire occurred not through ignorance, but through choice: the choice to conduct investigations in ways that consistently fail to verify harm, to accept jurisdictional confusion as operational framework, to substitute \"best practice\" letters for enforcement action, and to leave formal complaints unacknowledged until catastrophic failure forces temporary intervention.\n\nThey checked it out. They found nothing. And then exactly what residents warned about came true.\n\nThat's not regulatory failure. **That's regulatory function.**\n\n---\n\n**The full correspondence documenting this timeline is available through Freedom of Information requests to Ealing Council. Residents deserve to see what \"year-long daily investigation\" actually produces when applied to explicit warnings that later prove accurate.**\n",

Reality check? Pre-election day honesty?\n  \n>**HOUSE!?** Anyone?  \n  \nWho knows?   \n\n\n\n\n# Hitting The Target\n\n\n\n\nWell, now _**we**_ know. \n\n\n\n\nThanks to some erstwhile digging over at _The View From W5_, local investigative journalist Conal Urquhart has revealed that the number of genuinely affordable new homes built by Peter Mason's Ealing Labour during the period 2018 to 2026 is...\n\n\n\n\n>🎯🎯🎯 **ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY!!!** 🎯🎯🎯\n\n\n\n\nConal has been doing some really tremendous work across Ealing. As his recent article \"**[Ealing delivers 16 percent of its affordable homes target](https://open.substack.com/pub/theviewfromw5/p/ealing-delivers-16-percent-of-its-affordable-homes-target)**\" explains.\n\n\n\n\n> While Mason’s numbers ballooned on social media, the reality was brutal: £100 million was allocated to build 1,138 homes - and by 2026 Ealing has delivered just 180.\n\n\n\n\nNot quite a bullseye, Peter.\n\n\n\n\nHow can this be? How did Mason miss his target by so much?\n  \nHow did Peter Mason build just 16% of the new homes that he promised over and over again to deliver? \n\n\n\n\n# New Homes That Are, [In A Sense](https://southallstories.uk/2019/08/25/southall-under-siege-the-neighbours/), NOT New Homes\n\n\n\n\nMason's sleight of hand was what counts as a new home.\n\n\n\n\nAny normal person might reasonably expect that you count a new home as being built when a family on the housing waiting list moves in. \n\n\n\n\nYou would be wrong. \n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260116-220103.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"472\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Twitter conversation shows a discussion about housing numbers involving users David Marsden and Gregory Stafford MP.\">  \n\n\n\n\n--- \n\n\n\n\nA new home, in Peter Mason's world, is when a digger breaks earth on site - it's literally a hole in the ground. \n\n\n\n\nWhen Mason claimed in May 2020 that there were \"1,355 new homes available\", the council’s own performance dashboard shows this figure included homes that were merely onsite, started but not completed. \n\n\n\n\n>Unfinished building sites were presented to the public as available homes delivered.\n\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, many of Mason's claimed 2,700 or 2,500, or 2,000 new homes were never completed.\n\n\n\n\nNow you could say that this is not Mason's doing, it's just the way councils count new homes. And that's true. However, Mason was elected on a campaign where he promised not only thousands of new homes, but [\"to create a more open and transparent way of doing things\"](https://www.aroundealing.com/news/open-to-change-council-sets-out-new-policy-direction/). \n\n\n\n\n>Like many of these new homes, Peter Mason's promises turned to dust.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding foundations do not house families. Concrete frames do not reduce waiting lists. \n\n\n\n\nCounting holes in the ground as “available homes delivered” is performative theatre, playground pretend politics not grown-up housing policy.\n\n\n\n\nThis accounting trick allows failure to be repackaged and sold to the electorate as success - while families remain stuck in overcrowded, inappropriate and expensive temporary accommodation.\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260116-202438.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"960\" alt=\"A Twitter post by Peter Mason showcases a modern housing development at Norwood Road in Southall Green aimed at providing genuinely affordable homes, with an image of the homes and a retweet of Ealing Council's announcement about their construction.\">  \n\n\n\n\n--- \n  \n# The Southall Housing Disaster\n\n\n\n\nFour years ago, Mason had ascended the greasy leadership pole (metaphorically stomping on his predecessor and mentor Julian Bell's head [on the way up](https://ealingmatters.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210901-EM-newsletter-11-final.pdf)) and found himself perched precariously at its summit. \n\n\n\n\nGiddy with power, perhaps, and desperate to retain it just before the upcoming local elections, Peter proclaimed that he had built some beautiful and very much needed family homes in chronically overcrowded Southall Green, the ward he is elected to represent.  \n  \n>As is common with Peter Mason (and emperors with new wardrobes), all is often not as it seems. \n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/pxl-20260117-1351162372.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"451\" alt=\"A construction site billboard is overgrown with weeds and displays information about an affordable family housing project in Norwood Road, Southall, set for completion in 2023.\">\n\n\n\n\n--- \n  \nUnfortunately for Peter, and for the families desperate for a proper home of their own, the builders Peter hired went bust before completion. For three years we've been left with this half-built eyesore rotting in the rain.   \n  \n<img src=\"uploads/2026/pxl-20260117-135153885.mp2.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"451\" alt=\"Inside the Norwood Road construction site, Southall, with partially built purple brick structures, surrounded by scattered debris and construction materials.\">\n\n\n\n\n--- \n\n\n\n\nWhat makes this so much worse, is that Henry Construction's owners had [form](https://open.substack.com/pub/theviewfromw5/p/demolition-of-ealing-homes-part-of-trail-chaos).

The strategy reads like a corporate restructuring plan dressed up as community empowerment.</p>\n<p>The strategy isn&rsquo;t the beginning of Ealing&rsquo;s asset stripping programme - it&rsquo;s the public admission that the programme has been running systematically for almost two decades.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-dominion-centre-template-new-labours-greatest-hit\"><strong>The Dominion Centre Template: New Labour&rsquo;s Greatest Hit</strong></h2>\n<p>The blueprint was established in 2007 with Southall&rsquo;s Dominion Centre - where <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2024/05/19/the-cuckoos-nest/\">Ealing Labour&rsquo;s genocide supporters</a> now pose for their group photos. The original Southall library was closed and the Dominion community centre &ldquo;repurposed&rdquo; into this shiny multi-service hub that offers library services alongside &ldquo;study areas, exhibition space, community centre facilities, public computers, free WiFi, and service advisors for council enquiries.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It was perfect New Labour thinking: consolidate services, cut costs, and rebrand the reduction as &ldquo;modernisation.&rdquo; The Dominion Centre became the template for what the 2023 strategy now calls &ldquo;one-stop community hubs&rdquo; - the model being rolled out to replace purpose-built facilities across the borough.</p>\n<p>This is where Mason&rsquo;s true inspiration comes. In January 2014, he posted a photo of Tony Blair&rsquo;s 1994 &ldquo;Change and National Renewal&rdquo; manifesto, adding: &ldquo;Its content is as true now as it was 20 (yes, 20) years ago #tony.&rdquo; That Blair document became the blueprint for New Labour&rsquo;s PFI (private finance initiative) obsession - and Mason has been implementing its asset disposal philosophy ever since.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  &mdash;</p>\n<p>This was Thatcherism enacted by Ealing&rsquo;s own fanboy of Thatcher&rsquo;s greatest achievement, Tony Blair. Public assets re-conceptualised as &ldquo;underutilised resources&rdquo; requiring &ldquo;optimisation.&rdquo; The Dominion Centre pioneered the PFI <a href=\"https://www.common-wealth.org/interactive/who-owns-britain/data-dashboard/home\">dogma</a> that would define New Labour: why provide dedicated public services when you can cram everything into one building, call it efficiency, and sell off the valuable bits?</p>\n<p>Mason, himself a town planner, has perfected this model beyond Blair&rsquo;s (and Thatcher&rsquo;s) wildest dreams. Under his and his mentor and predecessor Julian Bell&rsquo;s leadership and direction, Ealing Labour has systematically disposed of or attempted to sell off libraries, children&rsquo;s centres, leisure centres, community golf courses, nature reserves, football and cricket pitches, town halls, community centres, and youth centres. It&rsquo;s PFI without the private finance - just the asset stripping.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-2011-monopoly-meeting-developers-set-the-agenda\"><strong>The 2011 Monopoly Meeting: Developers Set the Agenda</strong></h2>\n<p>By 2011, the programme was ready for acceleration. My investigation into the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2022/03/25/ealing-monopoly/\">Ealing Monopoly</a>&rdquo; meeting revealed unelected businessmen mapping out the systematic disposal of £20 million worth of public assets. Berkeley Group&rsquo;s Tony Pidgley advocated a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t waste a good crisis&rdquo; approach (later echoed by Julian Bell with regard to covid and implementing low traffic neighbourhoods) to public asset disposal, targeting &ldquo;buildings used for services for vulnerable adults, children and families.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The same Tony Pidgley who later boasted to a meeting with residents at the height of the Southall Gasworks poisoning scandal that he could &ldquo;phone Julian [Bell]&rdquo; and tell him &ldquo;to put a councillor on it&rdquo;.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The meeting wasn&rsquo;t secret - it was just conducted in the language of management consultancy that residents couldn&rsquo;t decode. They discussed &ldquo;strategic asset review,&rdquo; &ldquo;portfolio optimisation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;community empowerment&rdquo; - the same euphemisms that now fill the 2023 strategy document.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s remarkable about the 2011 document is how precisely it predicted what&rsquo;s happening now: Victoria Hall bundled into hotel developments, children&rsquo;s centres facing closure, community assets transferred to &ldquo;community ownership&rdquo; (meaning communities pay maintenance costs while losing democratic control).</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s long-time community activist and defender of local democracy Eric Leach explaining the sheer insanity of Ealing Council&rsquo;s position on their attempted sale of public heritage asset Victoria Hall. It&rsquo;s so bad, a high court judge had to intervene.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hahahugoshortcode-s0-hbhb\"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/t--SAZgvFwk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></h2>\n<h2 id=\"the-strategy-document-making-it-official\"><strong>The Strategy Document: Making It Official</strong></h2>\n<p>The 2023 strategy transforms thirteen years of ad hoc disposals into official policy. It establishes a &ldquo;corporate landlord model&rdquo; that centralises control over all assets, removing departmental protection that might preserve community facilities.</p>\n<p>The document&rsquo;s genius lies in its presentation: every disposal is reframed as &ldquo;community empowerment.&rdquo; Closing children&rsquo;s centres becomes &ldquo;empowering communities to own and manage spaces.&rdquo; Selling off Victoria Hall becomes &ldquo;optimising heritage assets.&rdquo; Cramming multiple services into inadequate spaces becomes &ldquo;creating inclusive hubs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mason&rsquo;s leadership allows him to be simultaneously the protector of services and the person implementing their systematic disposal - a remarkable administrative innovation worthy of his New Labour pedigree.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-childrens-centres-madness-libraries-and-faith-centres-as-nurseries\"><strong>The Children&rsquo;s Centres Madness: Libraries and Faith Centres as Nurseries</strong></h2>\n<p>The strategy document&rsquo;s euphemisms become even more absurd when applied to children&rsquo;s centres. Ealing proposes to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; services for under-fives by closing purpose-built, award-winning facilities and relocating services to libraries and faith centres.</p>\n<p>As I documented in the <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2025/07/12/so-it-goes-ai-on/\">children&rsquo;s centres campaign</a>, this means expecting toddlers to attend sessions in overcrowded libraries where &ldquo;small children like to make a lot of noise and run around&rdquo; next to people trying to read. Or pushing mainly female service users into &ldquo;highly patriarchal&rdquo; religious venues &ldquo;not known for confidentiality, and not designed for children&rsquo;s safe and secure play and development.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The strategy presents this as &ldquo;empowering communities to own and manage spaces&rdquo; while the council sells off the purpose-built, safe, inclusive buildings that actually work. It&rsquo;s the perfect inversion of public service logic: destroy what works, replace it with what doesn&rsquo;t, then claim you&rsquo;re &ldquo;improving&rdquo; services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-pay-rise-principle-----\"><strong>The Pay Rise Principle</strong>  &mdash;</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But perhaps Mason&rsquo;s most revealing statement comes in a video where he promises to &ldquo;work with developers who will help us deliver what we need.&rdquo; What Mason needs, it turns out, is <a href=\"https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&amp;spage=common/eacouncil220.htm\">substantial personal enrichment</a>. His Special Responsibility Allowance rose from £32,100 to £54,860 - a 70.9% increase that brought his total council remuneration to £66,874.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-victoria-hall-test-case\"><strong>The Victoria Hall Test Case</strong></h2>\n<p>Victoria Hall represents the perfect test case for this systematic programme. Eric Leach&rsquo;s legal challenge has exposed the governance failures that enable it: councils acting as &ldquo;sole trustee&rdquo; approving their own asset disposals, rubber-stamp committees with no real power, and qualified community candidates ignored when they apply to join oversight bodies.</p>\n<p>The £120,000 the Friends of Victoria Hall have raised for legal challenges represents communities learning to build the independent power necessary to challenge predetermined outcomes disguised as consultation.</p>\n<p>But Victoria Hall was never an isolated case. It&rsquo;s the implementation of a plan mapped out by developers in 2011, trialled with the Dominion Centre in 2007, and now formalised in the 2023 strategy that targets 760+ assets across Ealing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"people-before-buildings-the-perfect-slogan-----\"><strong>&ldquo;People Before Buildings&rdquo;: The Perfect Slogan</strong>  &mdash;</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>Mason&rsquo;s genius lies in his messaging consistency and ideological clarity. On January 15, 2015, he tweeted: &ldquo;Think its really important that we put people before buildings. Important we keep activities going &amp; that can be done in a different way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s the perfect slogan for systematic asset disposal. Why preserve purpose-built children&rsquo;s centres when you can relocate services to overcrowded libraries and faith centres? Why keep Victoria Hall when you can bundle it into a hotel development? The activities continue - just in worse conditions, with reduced access, serving fewer people.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People before buildings&rdquo; becomes the rhetorical cover for disposing of the buildings where people access services. It transforms every closure into an act of progressive politics. Mason has been refining this argument for a decade, and the 2023 strategy represents its ultimate expression: 760+ assets under &ldquo;review&rdquo; while claiming to prioritise community needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-mipim-pipeline-from-bell-to-mason\"><strong>The MIPIM Pipeline: From Bell to Mason</strong></h2>\n<p>The systematic disposal becomes more sinister when connected to the <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2022/12/17/the-property-lobby-the-hidden/\">£33,000+ in &ldquo;gifts&rdquo;</a> and MIPIM conference attendance that Mason and his predecessor Julian Bell accepted from developers, including Berkeley Group.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The visual evidence tells the story perfectly. At property conferences, Mason sits listening intently as Bell explains developer&rsquo;s &ldquo;long-term vision&rdquo; - not for residents, but for profitable disposal.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Elsewhere, Mason and Bell enjoy a pint together down the local pub, the mentor passing on his expertise to the protégé. At MIPIM-style events, they share champagne and development plans with property interests.</p>\n<p>When Berkeley Group literally sponsors council events with &ldquo;PROUDLY SPONSORED BY Berkeley&rdquo; branding, the capture becomes complete.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>When your town planner council leader and his mentor <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2022/12/17/the-property-lobby-the-hidden/\">take developer hospitality</a> while disposing of community assets, the conflicts of interest become embedded in the planning system itself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"democracy-20-now-with-less-democracy\"><strong>Democracy 2.0: Now With Less Democracy</strong></h2>\n<p>The system&rsquo;s crowning achievement is happening right now. In July 2025, Ealing Council <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2025/07/16/the-pied-piper-of-ealing/\">rewrote petition rules</a> in direct response to successful community campaigns, removing residents' rights to ask follow-up questions and requirements for senior officers to give evidence.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;ve solved the democracy problem by removing the democratic bits from democracy. It&rsquo;s the perfect complement to an asset disposal programme that operates through consultation theatre - predetermined outcomes with participation facades.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-bigger-picture\"><strong>The Bigger Picture</strong></h2>\n<p>What Ealing&rsquo;s 18-year asset disposal programme reveals isn&rsquo;t just local government corruption - it&rsquo;s the systematic implementation of neoliberal ideology through administrative process. The Dominion Centre model of 2007 has become the &ldquo;community hub&rdquo; euphemism of 2023, turning public assets into &ldquo;underutilised resources&rdquo; requiring &ldquo;optimisation.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>The 2011 developers' wish-list has become official council strategy. The governance failures Eric Leach exposed around Victoria Hall operate across every aspect of the programme. Mason&rsquo;s 70.9% pay rise and the £1m+ cost of his and councillor allowances increases while closing half of Ealing&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Centres to save a few hundred thousand pounds shows exactly whose side Ealing Labour are on. And it isn&rsquo;t ours!</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s Thatcherism with a human face - and that face belongs to Peter Mason, the New Labour politician who learned to speak her language fluently while pretending to oppose her legacy.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&mdash;</p>\n<p>The Victoria Hall campaign continues. The legal challenge proceeds. The 760+ assets remain under &ldquo;strategic review.&rdquo; And the machinery of systematic disposal, finally revealed in the 2023 strategy document, operates in plain sight - hidden only by the euphemistic language that transforms asset stripping into community empowerment.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Key Documents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18971/land_and_property_strategy.pdf\">Ealing Council 2023-2027 Land and Property Strategy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2022/03/25/ealing-monopoly/\">2011 &ldquo;Monopoly meeting&rdquo; exposé</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://savethevictoriahall.weebly.com/\">Victoria Hall legal challenge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g6611/Public%20reports%20pack%20Tuesday%2015-Jul-2025%2019.00%20Council.pdf?T=10\">July 2025 petition rule changes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Follow this story and more with a free subscription: <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/subscribe/\">southallstories.uk</a></em></p>\n",

In January 2014, he posted a photo of Tony Blair's 1994 \"Change and National Renewal\" manifesto, adding: \"Its content is as true now as it was 20 (yes, 20) years ago #tony.\" That Blair document became the blueprint for New Labour's PFI (private finance initiative) obsession - and Mason has been implementing its asset disposal philosophy ever since.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/screenshot-20220109-092617.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"829\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A booklet titled Change and National Renewal by Tony Blair MP is shown, described as an original copy from 20 years ago.\">  ---\n\n\nThis was Thatcherism enacted by Ealing's own fanboy of Thatcher's greatest achievement, Tony Blair. Public assets re-conceptualised as \"underutilised resources\" requiring \"optimisation.\" The Dominion Centre pioneered the PFI [dogma](https://www.common-wealth.org/interactive/who-owns-britain/data-dashboard/home) that would define New Labour: why provide dedicated public services when you can cram everything into one building, call it efficiency, and sell off the valuable bits?\n\n\nMason, himself a town planner, has perfected this model beyond Blair's (and Thatcher's) wildest dreams. Under his and his mentor and predecessor Julian Bell's leadership and direction, Ealing Labour has systematically disposed of or attempted to sell off libraries, children's centres, leisure centres, community golf courses, nature reserves, football and cricket pitches, town halls, community centres, and youth centres. It's PFI without the private finance - just the asset stripping.\n\n\n## **The 2011 Monopoly Meeting: Developers Set the Agenda**\n\n\nBy 2011, the programme was ready for acceleration. My investigation into the \"[Ealing Monopoly](https://southallstories.uk/2022/03/25/ealing-monopoly/)\" meeting revealed unelected businessmen mapping out the systematic disposal of £20 million worth of public assets. Berkeley Group's Tony Pidgley advocated a \"don't waste a good crisis\" approach (later echoed by Julian Bell with regard to covid and implementing low traffic neighbourhoods) to public asset disposal, targeting \"buildings used for services for vulnerable adults, children and families.\"\n\n\nThe same Tony Pidgley who later boasted to a meeting with residents at the height of the Southall Gasworks poisoning scandal that he could \"phone Julian [Bell]\" and tell him \"to put a councillor on it\".\n\n\n<audio src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/put-a-councillor-on-it.mp3\" controls=\"controls\" preload=\"metadata\"></audio>\n\n\nThe meeting wasn't secret - it was just conducted in the language of management consultancy that residents couldn't decode. They discussed \"strategic asset review,\" \"portfolio optimisation,\" and \"community empowerment\" - the same euphemisms that now fill the 2023 strategy document.\n\n\nWhat's remarkable about the 2011 document is how precisely it predicted what's happening now: Victoria Hall bundled into hotel developments, children's centres facing closure, community assets transferred to \"community ownership\" (meaning communities pay maintenance costs while losing democratic control).\n\n\nHere's long-time community activist and defender of local democracy Eric Leach explaining the sheer insanity of Ealing Council's position on their attempted sale of public heritage asset Victoria Hall. It's so bad, a high court judge had to intervene.\n\n\n{{< yt t--SAZgvFwk >}}\n---\n\n## **The Strategy Document: Making It Official**\n\n\nThe 2023 strategy transforms thirteen years of ad hoc disposals into official policy. It establishes a \"corporate landlord model\" that centralises control over all assets, removing departmental protection that might preserve community facilities.\n\n\nThe document's genius lies in its presentation: every disposal is reframed as \"community empowerment.\" Closing children's centres becomes \"empowering communities to own and manage spaces.\" Selling off Victoria Hall becomes \"optimising heritage assets.\" Cramming multiple services into inadequate spaces becomes \"creating inclusive hubs.\"\n\n\nMason's leadership allows him to be simultaneously the protector of services and the person implementing their systematic disposal - a remarkable administrative innovation worthy of his New Labour pedigree.\n\n\n## **The Children's Centres Madness: Libraries and Faith Centres as Nurseries**\n\n\nThe strategy document's euphemisms become even more absurd when applied to children's centres. Ealing proposes to \"improve\" services for under-fives by closing purpose-built, award-winning facilities and relocating services to libraries and faith centres.\n\n\nAs I documented in the [children's centres campaign](https://southallstories.uk/2025/07/12/so-it-goes-ai-on/), this means expecting toddlers to attend sessions in overcrowded libraries where \"small children like to make a lot of noise and run around\" next to people trying to read. Or pushing mainly female service users into \"highly patriarchal\" religious venues \"not known for confidentiality, and not designed for children's safe and secure play and development.\"\n\n\nThe strategy presents this as \"empowering communities to own and manage spaces\" while the council sells off the purpose-built, safe, inclusive buildings that actually work. It's the perfect inversion of public service logic: destroy what works, replace it with what doesn't, then claim you're \"improving\" services.\n\n\n## **The Pay Rise Principle**  ---\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/img-20220118-wa0025.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"339\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person wearing a coat and scarf speaks outside a modern building with large windows, while subtitles appear at the bottom.\">\n---\n\nBut perhaps Mason's most revealing statement comes in a video where he promises to \"work with developers who will help us deliver what we need.\" What Mason needs, it turns out, is [substantial personal enrichment](https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&spage=common/eacouncil220.htm). His Special Responsibility Allowance rose from £32,100 to £54,860 - a 70.9% increase that brought his total council remuneration to £66,874.\n\n\n## **The Victoria Hall Test Case**\n\n\nVictoria Hall represents the perfect test case for this systematic programme. Eric Leach's legal challenge has exposed the governance failures that enable it: councils acting as \"sole trustee\" approving their own asset disposals, rubber-stamp committees with no real power, and qualified community candidates ignored when they apply to join oversight bodies.\n\n\nThe £120,000 the Friends of Victoria Hall have raised for legal challenges represents communities learning to build the independent power necessary to challenge predetermined outcomes disguised as consultation.\n\n\nBut Victoria Hall was never an isolated case. It's the implementation of a plan mapped out by developers in 2011, trialled with the Dominion Centre in 2007, and now formalised in the 2023 strategy that targets 760+ assets across Ealing.\n\n\n## **\"People Before Buildings\": The Perfect Slogan**  ---\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/fc83f238fa.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two tweets by Peter Mason discuss prioritizing people over buildings and mention a meeting about community centers with Ealing Council.\">\n\n---\nMason's genius lies in his messaging consistency and ideological clarity. On January 15, 2015, he tweeted: \"Think its really important that we put people before buildings. Important we keep activities going & that can be done in a different way.\"\n\n\nIt's the perfect slogan for systematic asset disposal. Why preserve purpose-built children's centres when you can relocate services to overcrowded libraries and faith centres? Why keep Victoria Hall when you can bundle it into a hotel development? The activities continue - just in worse conditions, with reduced access, serving fewer people.\n\n\n\"People before buildings\" becomes the rhetorical cover for disposing of the buildings where people access services. It transforms every closure into an act of progressive politics. Mason has been refining this argument for a decade, and the 2023 strategy represents its ultimate expression: 760+ assets under \"review\" while claiming to prioritise community needs.\n\n\n## **The MIPIM Pipeline: From Bell to Mason**\n\n\nThe systematic disposal becomes more sinister when connected to the [£33,000+ in \"gifts\"](https://southallstories.uk/2022/12/17/the-property-lobby-the-hidden/) and MIPIM conference attendance that Mason and his predecessor Julian Bell accepted from developers, including Berkeley Group. \n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/img-20211110-wa0008.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"693\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two men are discussing a detailed architectural model with a backdrop showcasing Ealing's development plans.\">\n---\n\nThe visual evidence tells the story perfectly. At property conferences, Mason sits listening intently as Bell explains developer's \"long-term vision\" - not for residents, but for profitable disposal. \n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/screenshot-20210522-203508.png\" width=\"237\" height=\"254\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two men are sitting at a table with drinks and holding a framed picture between them.\">\n---\n\nElsewhere, Mason and Bell enjoy a pint together down the local pub, the mentor passing on his expertise to the protégé. At MIPIM-style events, they share champagne and development plans with property interests. \n\n\nWhen Berkeley Group literally sponsors council events with \"PROUDLY SPONSORED BY Berkeley\" branding, the capture becomes complete.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/pmtq12.jpg\" width=\"410\" height=\"178\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A sponsorship wall displays logos of various companies, including British Land and Berkeley, with the prominent text Ealing London on the left.\">\n---\n\nWhen your town planner council leader and his mentor [take developer hospitality](https://southallstories.uk/2022/12/17/the-property-lobby-the-hidden/) while disposing of community assets, the conflicts of interest become embedded in the planning system itself.\n\n\n## **Democracy 2.0: Now With Less Democracy**\n\n\nThe system's crowning achievement is happening right now. In July 2025, Ealing Council [rewrote petition rules](https://southallstories.uk/2025/07/16/the-pied-piper-of-ealing/) in direct response to successful community campaigns, removing residents' rights to ask follow-up questions and requirements for senior officers to give evidence.\n\n\nThey've solved the democracy problem by removing the democratic bits from democracy. It's the perfect complement to an asset disposal programme that operates through consultation theatre - predetermined outcomes with participation facades.\n\n\n## **The Bigger Picture**\n\n\nWhat Ealing's 18-year asset disposal programme reveals isn't just local government corruption - it's the systematic implementation of neoliberal ideology through administrative process. The Dominion Centre model of 2007 has become the \"community hub\" euphemism of 2023, turning public assets into \"underutilised resources\" requiring \"optimisation.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/img-20220216-wa0005.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"346\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two people in safety gear are enjoying a snack of popcorn at a construction site.\">\n\n---\nThe 2011 developers' wish-list has become official council strategy. The governance failures Eric Leach exposed around Victoria Hall operate across every aspect of the programme. Mason's 70.9% pay rise and the £1m+ cost of his and councillor allowances increases while closing half of Ealing's Children's Centres to save a few hundred thousand pounds shows exactly whose side Ealing Labour are on. And it isn't ours!\n\n\nIt's Thatcherism with a human face - and that face belongs to Peter Mason, the New Labour politician who learned to speak her language fluently while pretending to oppose her legacy.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/img-20211223-wa0006.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"363\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person with a microphone stands outdoors next to a decorated tree, wearing a coat and scarf, with the text I'm sorry that visible.\">---\n\n\nThe Victoria Hall campaign continues. The legal challenge proceeds. The 760+ assets remain under \"strategic review.\" And the machinery of systematic disposal, finally revealed in the 2023 strategy document, operates in plain sight - hidden only by the euphemistic language that transforms asset stripping into community empowerment.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Key Documents:**\n- [Ealing Council 2023-2027 Land and Property Strategy](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18971/land_and_property_strategy.pdf)\n- [2011 \"Monopoly meeting\" exposé](https://southallstories.uk/2022/03/25/ealing-monopoly/)\n- [Victoria Hall legal challenge](https://savethevictoriahall.weebly.com/)\n- [July 2025 petition rule changes](https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g6611/Public%20reports%20pack%20Tuesday%2015-Jul-2025%2019.00%20Council.pdf?T=10)\n\n\n*Follow this story and more with a free subscription: [southallstories.uk](https://southallstories.uk/subscribe/)*\n",

On January 15, 2015, he tweeted: <em>&ldquo;Think its really important that we put people before buildings. Important we keep activities going &amp; that can be done in a different way.&quot;</em></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Ten years later, he&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xv1ylplzzo\">closing children&rsquo;s centres</a>, buildings where people access those activities.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t hypocrisy - it&rsquo;s innovation. Why limit yourself to consistent principles when you can have all the principles, simultaneously?</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel, a parent trying to save her local children&rsquo;s centre, discovered this when she attempted to navigate Ealing&rsquo;s democratic processes. What she found was a system so logically perfect that resistance had become mathematically impossible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-2-the-democratic-möbius-strip\">Chapter 2: The Democratic Möbius Strip</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Who decides about children&rsquo;s centre closures?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked at a council meeting.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ldquo;The Cabinet,&rdquo; she was told.</p>\n<p>The Cabinet explained they were implementing officer recommendations based on budget pressures created by government policy following community consultation showing residents wanted services maintained differently.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So who can change the decision?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The decision-makers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who are the decision-makers?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The people with authority to make decisions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who has that authority?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The decision-makers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel found herself trapped in a perfectly circular system. To influence the decision, she needed to identify who made it. But everyone who appeared to make decisions claimed to be implementing someone else&rsquo;s decisions. The decision seemed to exist independently of anyone actually deciding anything.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It was like a democratic Möbius strip - no matter which direction you followed, you always ended up back where you started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-3-the-mathematics-of-progressive-budget-management\">Chapter 3: The Mathematics of Progressive Budget Management</h2>\n<p>The numbers, at least, were clear:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost of councillor allowance increases (2022-2025):</strong> Over £1 million</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/3-ealing-childrens-centres-saved-31844687\">Savings</a> from closing children&rsquo;s centres:</strong> £750,000</li>\n<li><strong>Council Leader&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://ealing.news/ealing-council/ealing-council-leader-peter-mason-massive-allowance-rise-by-over-70-along-with-increases-for-his-cabinet/\">pay rise</a>:</strong> 70%</li>\n<li><strong>Number of children&rsquo;s centres being closed in Southall:</strong> 3 out of 6</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Council Leader had discovered something revolutionary: you could simultaneously claim budget constraints while voting yourself substantial pay rises. The secret was treating these as completely unrelated mathematical operations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have to make difficult decisions due to budget pressures,&rdquo; he explained, while awarding himself £58,000 annually.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But you spent more on pay rises than you&rsquo;re saving,&rdquo; Mrs. Patel pointed out.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different budget.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same money.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand local government finance. And we need <a href=\"https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&amp;spage=common/eacouncil220.htm\">higher calibre</a> councillor candidates.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-4-environmental-priorities---a-scientific-approach\">Chapter 4: Environmental Priorities - A Scientific Approach</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader&rsquo;s environmental consciousness follows a precise hierarchy, documented through his public responses:</p>\n<p><strong>Tier 1 Emergency Response:</strong> Eels gasping in the River Brent receive <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18312/to_thames_water_-_sewage_entering_into_the_river_brent.pdf\">immediate action</a> [pdf) and public concern.</p>\n<p><strong>Tier 2 Public Complaint:</strong> Someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;bag and/or small child&rdquo; taking up a tube seat merits a public tweet about &ldquo;Some people.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><strong>Tier 3 Busy Schedule:</strong> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xA4mI_OAzxs\">Children gasping from toxic air</a> [YouTube] in bedrooms get told &quot; <a href=\"https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxCUBKF53mk-J0KrZ4bxXaoAxc9iVEQhN-\">I&rsquo;m very busy.</a>&rdquo; [YouTube)]</p>\n<p>When five-year-old Zion asked him directly, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/w-p6qy2RfR8\">Peter, why didn&rsquo;t you help us?</a>&rdquo; [YouTube] about the gasworks poisoning, the response was so technical that Zion said it was &ldquo;too sciencey&rdquo; to understand.</p>\n<p>This established a clear principle: if environmental concerns can&rsquo;t be explained to five-year-olds, they&rsquo;re probably too complex for five-year-olds to experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-5-the-southall-paradox\">Chapter 5: The Southall Paradox</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Only in Southall can carcinogenic benzene, and naphthalene - which is known to be potentially <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3850774/\">fatal to some people with African and Asian heritage</a> - be released into the air from the Gasworks development at levels way <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CGGyCDAHRt4?si=OtAGYXGA2CQ1y3q5&amp;utm_source=MTQxZ\">above legal limits</a> and be simultaneously &ldquo;not hazardous&rdquo; according to Ealing Council.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>One moment the Headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School is <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hB66yX40-q-YYi6EKOTvE20DTx422_g3/view?usp=drivesdk\">reporting asthma and headaches</a> [p. 10] caused by very strong smells from the Gasworks site; in another moment, the developer&rsquo;s head of construction is appointed to the school&rsquo;s board of governors [pp. 7-8] and arranges to remove dead rats from the nursery playground [p. 11]. These events are clearly unconnected.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s all perfectly normal in Southall, where <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/cleanair-for-southall-and-hayes-stop-berkeleygroupuk-s-southallwaterside-polluting-our-kids-southalllivesmatter/u/23019750\">kids can be locked in class without ventilation on hot days</a> to protect them from the harmless petrol odour, and the developer&rsquo;s &ldquo;community liaison officer&rdquo; can <a href=\"https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1926034207492407709\">simultaneously</a> be the chair of Southall&rsquo;s charity umbrella organisation, an ex-Tory tobacco salesman whose former employer <a href=\"https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1630863285892333569\">paid for our ex-MP&rsquo;s research assistant</a> to attend a jolly. Nothing to see here!</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get even more interesting. The Council&rsquo;s own &ldquo;<a href=\"https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s1726/Southall%20Reset.pdf\">Southall Reset</a>&rdquo; [pdf] document acknowledges that &ldquo;challenges of deprivation, low pay, are particularly acute&rdquo; in Southall, contributing to &ldquo;deeply embedded health and wellbeing challenges.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Race Equality Commission Report &ldquo;highlighted the need for an investment in adequate primary care in Southall&rdquo; and &ldquo;deeper meaningful engagement, and better conversations with residents.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Council&rsquo;s response to this need for MORE investment? Close children&rsquo;s centres.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So you know we need MORE investment?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. The evidence is clear,&rdquo; they said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Then why are you closing children&rsquo;s centres?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Budget pressures.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But your own report says we need more investment, not less.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different report.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your report. You wrote it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Different department.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Same council.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Different budget.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Same money.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand local government.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. They could officially acknowledge that Southall needed more investment while simultaneously cutting investment. They could document the problem and implement policies that made it worse. Each document existed in its own logical universe, disconnected from actual decisions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-6-the-mipim-negotiations\">Chapter 6: The MIPIM Negotiations</h2>\n<p>Every year, the Council Leader attends MIPIM in Cannes - what Private Eye calls a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://stopthetowers.info/the-mipim-jolly\">booze &lsquo;n&rsquo; hookerfest</a>&rdquo; - with expenses paid by Berkeley Group, the company behind the gasworks development that&rsquo;s been poisoning Southall residents.</p>\n<p>He goes to &ldquo;negotiate hard&rdquo; with developers.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The documented results of these negotiations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More developments approved</li>\n<li>Continued toxic air from gasworks</li>\n<li>Larger councillor allowances</li>\n<li>Closure of community facilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Either he&rsquo;s a remarkably poor negotiator, or &ldquo;negotiating hard&rdquo; means something different in Cannes than it does in English.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-7-the-zionist-anti-zionist-synthesis\">Chapter 7: The Zionist-Anti-Zionist Synthesis</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader represents Southall Green - 69% BAME, one of the most ethnically diverse wards in Britain. Many of his constituents have strong views about Palestinian liberation.</p>\n<p>His attitude? &ldquo;People who commit themselves to being opposed to Jewish national self determination / liberation aren&rsquo;t my cup of tea. They can exist, sure, just outside of the Labour movement.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So he simultaneously represents a diverse community while working to exclude people from that community based on their views about Middle Eastern politics.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a masterclass in representation: represent everyone, except the people whose politics you disagree with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-8-the-protection-by-destruction-innovation\">Chapter 8: The Protection-by-Destruction Innovation</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader has pioneered a new approach to public service: protecting things by eliminating them.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Govt Commissioners to slash and burn services,&rdquo; he explains, while slashing and burning services.</p>\n<p>It was like watching someone slash the low-hanging fruit on the trees and then set fire to the orchard; then selling the &ldquo;infertile land&rdquo; to developers when there&rsquo;s nothing to eat.</p>\n<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t even the worst part. Mrs. Patel had discovered something even more troubling. Back in 2012, a group of unelected businessmen had met to play <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W2HRPD00OiidxP9iAlLPDFHPVwZcEfeM/view?usp=drivesdk\">Monopoly</a> [pdf] with public assets. Not the board game - though the principle was identical. They wanted to &ldquo;sell off our public assets for £20m profit.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Their target included &ldquo;buildings used for services for vulnerable adults, children and families.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So they planned this years ago?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked the councillor.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about that,&rdquo; the councillor said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re closing children&rsquo;s centres,&rdquo; Mrs. Patel said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting services by cutting them,&rdquo; they explained patiently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Government Commissioners to slash and burn services.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But you ARE slashing and burning services.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting them by cutting them responsibly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How is closing them protecting them?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t close them, someone else will close them worse.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ldquo;The Government Commissioners.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Have they said they&rsquo;ll close them?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re closing them to prevent them being closed?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting them by cutting them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Round and round she went, trapped in a perfectly logical system designed to make resistance impossible.</p>\n<p>The beautiful thing was that everyone was telling the truth. The councillor really didn&rsquo;t know about the 2012 meeting. The 2012 meeting really had happened. The plan really was being implemented. Nobody was really in charge of implementing it.</p>\n<p>Somehow, a decision made by people who didn&rsquo;t officially exist was being executed by people who officially couldn&rsquo;t stop it.\nThis allows him to be simultaneously the protector of services and the person closing services - a remarkable administrative innovation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-9-democracy-20---now-with-less-democracy\">Chapter 9: Democracy 2.0 - Now With Less Democracy</h2>\n<p>But the system&rsquo;s crowning achievement is happening right now. <strong>This month - July 2025 - Ealing Council is rewriting the petition rules</strong> in direct response to successful community campaigns.</p>\n<p>On page 294 of their July 15, 2025 council <a href=\"https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g6611/Public%20reports%20pack%20Tuesday%2015-Jul-2025%2019.00%20Council.pdf?T=10\">papers</a> [pdf, see p. 294], you can see democracy being crossed out in real time. They&rsquo;re removing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Residents' rights to ask follow-up questions</li>\n<li>Requirements for senior officers to give evidence</li>\n<li>Meaningful participation in debates about their own petitions</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>They&rsquo;ve solved the democracy problem by removing the democratic bits from democracy.</p>\n<p>The timing is perfect: after communities proved they could win by building independent pressure (Save Southall Young Adult Centre, Save Southall Town Hall, Save Warren Farm Nature Reserve), the council is changing the rules to prevent it happening again.</p>\n<p>Soon residents will be able to petition - they just won&rsquo;t be able to ask questions, get answers, or participate in discussions about their concerns.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s democracy in name only, which is much more efficient than the old democracy where people could actually influence things.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-10-the-southall-young-adult-centre-miracle\">Chapter 10: The Southall Young Adult Centre Miracle</h2>\n<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing - resistance is still possible. In 2022, the Council wanted to demolish Southall Young Adult Centre to build 60 flats. The usual process commenced: consultation theater, predetermined decisions, official helplessness.</p>\n<p>Then the &ldquo;Save Southall Young Adult Centre&rdquo; campaign launched. They didn&rsquo;t try to work within the impossible system. They built independent pressure. They refused to accept that &ldquo;decisions had been made.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>They <a href=\"https://www.visitsouthall.co.uk/News/NewsDetails.php?recordID=1235\">won</a>.</p>\n<p>The centre was saved.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We stopped playing by their rules,&rdquo; the organisers said. &ldquo;We built power they couldn&rsquo;t ignore.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-11-the-impossible-solution\">Chapter 11: The Impossible Solution</h2>\n<p>Mrs. Patel realized the children&rsquo;s centres could be saved the same way. But it would require doing something the system said was impossible: organising outside the official channels, building independent power, refusing to accept predetermined outcomes.</p>\n<p>The Council had just changed the petition rules specifically to prevent another people-powered victory. But that only proved they were afraid of effective organising.</p>\n<p>The system&rsquo;s weakness was its strength: it was so obviously absurd that anyone paying attention could see through it.</p>\n<p>The Council Leader could tweet about putting &ldquo;people before buildings&rdquo; while closing buildings where people accessed services. He could claim to protect services while cutting them. He could represent diverse communities while excluding their political views. He could prioritize eels over children and call it environmentalism.</p>\n<p>All of this was only possible because residents had been playing by rules designed to make them lose.</p>\n<p>But the campaigns to save the Young Adult Centre, the Town Hall and Warren Farm proved the rules could be broken.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-12-the-choice\">Chapter 12: The Choice</h2>\n<p>Mrs. Patel had a choice. She could continue navigating the impossible bureaucracy, filing petitions that couldn&rsquo;t ask questions, attending consultations about predetermined decisions, lobbying councillors who claimed to have no power.</p>\n<p>Or she could do what the other campaigners did: build independent power and refuse to accept defeat.</p>\n<p>The children&rsquo;s centres could be saved. But only if parents stopped trying to reason with an unreasonable system and started building the power to change it.</p>\n<p>The Council Leader would continue inhabiting his world of simultaneous contradictions, where closing centres meant protecting them and cutting services meant investing in communities.</p>\n<p>But Mrs. Patel had learned something important: impossible things happen every day in Ealing politics.</p>\n<p>If the Council Leader could be simultaneously progressive and regressive, protective and destructive, representative and exclusionary, then maybe Mrs. Patel could do something equally impossible.</p>\n<p>Like save a children&rsquo;s centre.</p>\n<p>The Young Adult Centre campaigners had already shown it could be done.</p>\n<p>Now it was the children&rsquo;s centres' turn.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Even this right wing authoritarian Labour government thinks it&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvj1jr0kz0o\">bad idea</a> to close children&rsquo;s centres.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-13-the-engagement-paradox\">Chapter 13: The Engagement Paradox</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader had perfected the art of simultaneous engagement.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>He could tweet about &ldquo;absolutely committed to engaging, listening and compromising&rdquo; while sharing photos of residents protesting his refusal to engage, listen, or compromise.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>He spoke frequently about &ldquo;transparent engagement&rdquo; and &ldquo;finding the compromises everyone needs to make&rdquo; - usually while explaining why the compromises residents needed to make were accepting whatever he&rsquo;d already decided.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Even councillors who were &ldquo;most responsive&rdquo; resigned rather than &ldquo;effectively endorse his toxic brand of politics.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But the real innovation was tweeting &ldquo;Welcome to Dystopia&rdquo; while creating it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"chapter-14-the-investment-paradox\">Chapter 14: The Investment Paradox</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader had achieved something remarkable: he could simultaneously remember genocide while investing in it. &ldquo;Remember Yesterday, Act Today,&rdquo; his council posted about the genocide of 8,732 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica thirty years ago, while <a href=\"https://lgpsdivest.org/lgps-investments/\">investing £112 million</a> in companies enabling genocide of <a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/news/2025/05/un-women-estimates-over-28000-women-and-girls-killed-in-gaza-since-october-2023\">more than 28,000 women and girls</a> in Gaza today. <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unimaginable-horrors-more-50000-children-reportedly-killed-or-injured-gaza-strip\">More than 50,000 children killed or injured</a> in Gaza to pay for his pension.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It was beautifully efficient. Why limit yourself to one genocide when you could remember one while funding another? The children understood perfectly.</p>\n<p>Equally impressive was his ability to close children&rsquo;s centres for budget reasons while sitting on the board as a <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/opdc_2020.21_audited_annual_report_and_accounts.pdf\">paid director</a> [pdf] of a corporation that had just received £140 million in public funding. The logic was flawless: children&rsquo;s services were unaffordable, but corporate development was essential.</p>\n<p>The Council Leader had mastered the art of proportional response. Children&rsquo;s centres closing to save £750,000? Budget pressures, difficult decisions, no choice. Sitting on the board overseeing &ldquo;one of the biggest regeneration schemes in Europe&rdquo; with £140 million in funding? That was worth £2,000 a year of his valuable time.</p>\n<p>It was a masterclass in priorities: Europe&rsquo;s biggest regeneration project required his oversight, but Southall&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s centres were an unaffordable luxury.</p>\n<p>He could simultaneously claim there was no money for community services while helping to plan a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/fresh-pictures-reveal-what-london-22320564\">mini-Manhattan</a>&rdquo; in his own borough. The vision was clear: 54-storey towers, yes. Children&rsquo;s centres, no.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;d found the perfect balance: cut services locally to save money, earn money regionally to oversee developers' profits. It was like a perpetual motion machine of fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-and-verse-the-evolution-of-enlightenment\">Chapter and Verse: The Evolution of Enlightenment</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In 2010, our future Council Leader shared his frustration about &ldquo;sitting around not understanding all this punjabi&rdquo; at community meetings in the area he would later represent.</p>\n<p>By 2020, he had evolved. &ldquo;Words have consequences,&rdquo; he tweeted. &ldquo;Impact is as important as intent. Culture is defined by leadership.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Ten years of personal growth had taught him that words matter. Which made it remarkable that he could simultaneously lecture about cultural sensitivity while closing community centres in the same diverse communities he&rsquo;d once struggled to understand. It was a masterclass in progressive evolution: you could acknowledge that words have consequences while ensuring your own words from the past had none.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>Readers who think this is all a bit unfair, unbelievable, unhelpful or downright unlawful&hellip;</p>\n<p>The most revealing evidence of how the system works came from inside the machine itself. In 2022, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hZfSB-RR7OzeCIHclKdiJd_FTnUtT7KA/view?usp=drivesdk\">leaked WhatsApp messages</a> [pdf] from the Ealing Labour councillors' group chat revealed what they really thought about their leadership.</p>\n<p>Mason&rsquo;s own Labour colleagues called the Council Leader &ldquo;callous, ruthless, sectarian.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>They discussed votes of no confidence, referenced &ldquo;corruption and even theft&rdquo; regarding the previous leader, and debated &ldquo;bribes&rdquo; and &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; for loyalty. Meanwhile, publicly, they maintained perfect unity and collective responsibility. It was the perfect illustration of how the system works: private recognition of the problems, public performance of harmony.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel understood perfectly. The same councillors who privately criticised authoritarian leadership accepted Mason&rsquo;s cabinet positions and pay rises to sit in silent support during council meetings.The leaked messages proved Mrs. Patel wasn&rsquo;t imagining the contradictions - even the people inside the system could see them.

Important we keep activities going & that can be done in a different way.\"*\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/fc83f238fa.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason emphasizes prioritizing people over buildings and discusses Ealing Council's community centers at a committee meeting.\">\n\n\nTen years later, he's [closing children's centres](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xv1ylplzzo), buildings where people access those activities.\n\n\nThis isn't hypocrisy - it's innovation. Why limit yourself to consistent principles when you can have all the principles, simultaneously?\n\n\nMrs. Patel, a parent trying to save her local children's centre, discovered this when she attempted to navigate Ealing's democratic processes. What she found was a system so logically perfect that resistance had become mathematically impossible.\n\n\n## Chapter 2: The Democratic Möbius Strip\n\n\n\"Who decides about children's centre closures?\" Mrs. Patel asked at a council meeting.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/98e8dd79de.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two men are discussing next to an illuminated architectural model, with a display board about Ealing's short-term vision in the background.\">\n\n\n\"The Cabinet,\" she was told.\n\n\nThe Cabinet explained they were implementing officer recommendations based on budget pressures created by government policy following community consultation showing residents wanted services maintained differently.\n\n\n\"So who can change the decision?\"\n\n\n\"The decision-makers.\"\n\n\n\"Who are the decision-makers?\"\n\n\n\"The people with authority to make decisions.\"\n\n\n\"Who has that authority?\"\n\n\n\"The decision-makers.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel found herself trapped in a perfectly circular system. To influence the decision, she needed to identify who made it. But everyone who appeared to make decisions claimed to be implementing someone else's decisions. The decision seemed to exist independently of anyone actually deciding anything.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/0be5b8f75d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Möbius strip, shown with a twist and a small person observing, illustrates its unique one-sided property.\">\nImage: Jono Hey, [Sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/mobius-strip)\n\n\nIt was like a democratic Möbius strip - no matter which direction you followed, you always ended up back where you started.\n\n\n## Chapter 3: The Mathematics of Progressive Budget Management\n\n\nThe numbers, at least, were clear:\n\n\n- **Cost of councillor allowance increases (2022-2025):** Over £1 million\n- **[Savings](https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/3-ealing-childrens-centres-saved-31844687) from closing children's centres:** £750,000\n- **Council Leader's [pay rise](https://ealing.news/ealing-council/ealing-council-leader-peter-mason-massive-allowance-rise-by-over-70-along-with-increases-for-his-cabinet/):** 70%\n- **Number of children's centres being closed in Southall:** 3 out of 6\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7bb908e3f4.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"778\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A group of people are holding signs in a protest, with one reading KIDS OUT! Someone has to pay for my 70% pay rise and another reading NO MORE PLAY SCHOOL!.\">\n\n\nThe Council Leader had discovered something revolutionary: you could simultaneously claim budget constraints while voting yourself substantial pay rises. The secret was treating these as completely unrelated mathematical operations.\n\n\n\"We have to make difficult decisions due to budget pressures,\" he explained, while awarding himself £58,000 annually.\n\n\n\"But you spent more on pay rises than you're saving,\" Mrs. Patel pointed out.\n\n\n\"That's a different budget.\"\n\n\n\"It's the same money.\"\n\n\n\"You don't understand local government finance. And we need [higher calibre](https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&spage=common/eacouncil220.htm) councillor candidates.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly.\n\n\n## Chapter 4: Environmental Priorities - A Scientific Approach\n\n\nThe Council Leader's environmental consciousness follows a precise hierarchy, documented through his public responses:\n\n\n**Tier 1 Emergency Response:** Eels gasping in the River Brent receive [immediate action](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18312/to_thames_water_-_sewage_entering_into_the_river_brent.pdf) [pdf) and public concern.\n\n\n**Tier 2 Public Complaint:** Someone's \"bag and/or small child\" taking up a tube seat merits a public tweet about \"Some people.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/c0020bb277.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"253\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Peter Mason tweets about taking the tube instead of cycling and needing someone to move their bag or child for him to sit.\">\n\n\n**Tier 3 Busy Schedule:** [Children gasping from toxic air](https://youtu.be/xA4mI_OAzxs) [YouTube] in bedrooms get told \" [I'm very busy.](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxCUBKF53mk-J0KrZ4bxXaoAxc9iVEQhN-)\" [YouTube)]\n\n\nWhen five-year-old Zion asked him directly, \"[Peter, why didn't you help us?](https://youtu.be/w-p6qy2RfR8)\" [YouTube] about the gasworks poisoning, the response was so technical that Zion said it was \"too sciencey\" to understand.\n\n\nThis established a clear principle: if environmental concerns can't be explained to five-year-olds, they're probably too complex for five-year-olds to experience.\n\n\n## Chapter 5: The Southall Paradox\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/74597bfcfb.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"224\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A bar graph compares the concentrations of various toxic hydrocarbons from Southall Old Gasworks Soil Hospital across different monitoring periods in 2018 and 2019, highlighting levels of Benzene, Naphthalene, Toluene, Xylene, Trimethylbenzenes, and 4-Iso-propyltoluene with legal limits indicated for Benzene and Naphthalene.\">\n\n\nOnly in Southall can carcinogenic benzene, and naphthalene - which is known to be potentially [fatal to some people with African and Asian heritage](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3850774/) - be released into the air from the Gasworks development at levels way [above legal limits](https://youtu.be/CGGyCDAHRt4?si=OtAGYXGA2CQ1y3q5&utm_source=MTQxZ) and be simultaneously \"not hazardous\" according to Ealing Council. \n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/6624f74972.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"254\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Ealing Council tweets that they are monitoring reports of strong odours at a Berkeley Group construction site in Southall Gasworks, assuring the odours aren't hazardous and should clear in a few days.\">\n\n\nOne moment the Headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School is [reporting asthma and headaches](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hB66yX40-q-YYi6EKOTvE20DTx422_g3/view?usp=drivesdk) [p. 10] caused by very strong smells from the Gasworks site; in another moment, the developer's head of construction is appointed to the school's board of governors [pp. 7-8] and arranges to remove dead rats from the nursery playground [p. 11]. These events are clearly unconnected.\n\n\nIt's all perfectly normal in Southall, where [kids can be locked in class without ventilation on hot days](https://www.change.org/p/cleanair-for-southall-and-hayes-stop-berkeleygroupuk-s-southallwaterside-polluting-our-kids-southalllivesmatter/u/23019750) to protect them from the harmless petrol odour, and the developer's \"community liaison officer\" can [simultaneously](https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1926034207492407709) be the chair of Southall's charity umbrella organisation, an ex-Tory tobacco salesman whose former employer [paid for our ex-MP's research assistant](https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1630863285892333569) to attend a jolly. Nothing to see here!\n\n\nHere's where things get even more interesting. The Council's own \"[Southall Reset](https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s1726/Southall%20Reset.pdf)\" [pdf] document acknowledges that \"challenges of deprivation, low pay, are particularly acute\" in Southall, contributing to \"deeply embedded health and wellbeing challenges.\" \n\n\nThe Race Equality Commission Report \"highlighted the need for an investment in adequate primary care in Southall\" and \"deeper meaningful engagement, and better conversations with residents.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/6d6e997a4e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"143\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Challenges in Southall include deprivation, low pay, and the need for improved primary care and community engagement.\">\n\n\nThe Council's response to this need for MORE investment? Close children's centres.\n\n\n\"So you know we need MORE investment?\" Mrs. Patel asked.\n\n\n\"Absolutely. The evidence is clear,\" they said.\n\n\n\"Then why are you closing children's centres?\"\n\n\n\"Budget pressures.\"\n\n\n\"But your own report says we need more investment, not less.\"\n\n\n\"That's a different report.\"\n\n\n\"It's your report. You wrote it.\"\n\n\n\"Different department.\"\n\n\n\"Same council.\"\n\n\n\"Different budget.\"\n\n\n\"Same money.\"\n\n\n\"You don't understand local government.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. They could officially acknowledge that Southall needed more investment while simultaneously cutting investment. They could document the problem and implement policies that made it worse. Each document existed in its own logical universe, disconnected from actual decisions.\n\n\n## Chapter 6: The MIPIM Negotiations\n\n\nEvery year, the Council Leader attends MIPIM in Cannes - what Private Eye calls a \"[booze 'n' hookerfest](https://stopthetowers.info/the-mipim-jolly)\" - with expenses paid by Berkeley Group, the company behind the gasworks development that's been poisoning Southall residents.\n\n\nHe goes to \"negotiate hard\" with developers.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/cac51e7bb8.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"650\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses negotiating for genuinely affordable homes at MIPIM, contrasting it with the idea of it being a holiday.\">\n\n\nThe documented results of these negotiations:\n- More developments approved\n- Continued toxic air from gasworks\n- Larger councillor allowances\n- Closure of community facilities\n\n\nEither he's a remarkably poor negotiator, or \"negotiating hard\" means something different in Cannes than it does in English.\n\n\n## Chapter 7: The Zionist-Anti-Zionist Synthesis \n\n\nThe Council Leader represents Southall Green - 69% BAME, one of the most ethnically diverse wards in Britain. Many of his constituents have strong views about Palestinian liberation.\n\n\nHis attitude? \"People who commit themselves to being opposed to Jewish national self determination / liberation aren't my cup of tea. They can exist, sure, just outside of the Labour movement.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/160bd2a958.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"382\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person shares their perspective on anti-Zionism and Jewish national self-determination in a social media post.\">\n\n\nSo he simultaneously represents a diverse community while working to exclude people from that community based on their views about Middle Eastern politics.\n\n\nIt's a masterclass in representation: represent everyone, except the people whose politics you disagree with.\n\n\n## Chapter 8: The Protection-by-Destruction Innovation\n\n\nThe Council Leader has pioneered a new approach to public service: protecting things by eliminating them.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/c19f8ce2da.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"356\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason responds to Tom Gann, defending a decision to protect frontline services instead of cutting them.\">\n\n\n\"We've made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Govt Commissioners to slash and burn services,\" he explains, while slashing and burning services.\n\n\nIt was like watching someone slash the low-hanging fruit on the trees and then set fire to the orchard; then selling the \"infertile land\" to developers when there's nothing to eat.\n\n\nBut that wasn't even the worst part. Mrs. Patel had discovered something even more troubling. Back in 2012, a group of unelected businessmen had met to play [Monopoly](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W2HRPD00OiidxP9iAlLPDFHPVwZcEfeM/view?usp=drivesdk) [pdf] with public assets. Not the board game - though the principle was identical. They wanted to \"sell off our public assets for £20m profit.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/deb63dd611.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"703\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Monopoly game board is shown with green houses scattered on the board and the surrounding table.\">\n\n\nTheir target included \"buildings used for services for vulnerable adults, children and families.\"\n\n\n\"So they planned this years ago?\" Mrs. Patel asked the councillor.\n\n\n\"I wouldn't know anything about that,\" the councillor said.\n\n\n\"But you're closing children's centres,\" Mrs. Patel said.\n\n\n\"We're protecting services by cutting them,\" they explained patiently. \"We've made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Government Commissioners to slash and burn services.\"\n\n\n\"But you ARE slashing and burning services.\"\n\n\n\"We're protecting them by cutting them responsibly.\"\n\n\n\"How is closing them protecting them?\"\n\n\n\"If we don't close them, someone else will close them worse.\"\n\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f5fcab7334.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"365\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses the importance of members shaping manifestos and taking responsibility for decisions, emphasizing the role of residents.\">\n\n\n\"The Government Commissioners.\"\n\n\n\"Have they said they'll close them?\"\n\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\n\"So you're closing them to prevent them being closed?\"\n\n\n\"We're protecting them by cutting them.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Round and round she went, trapped in a perfectly logical system designed to make resistance impossible.\n\n\nThe beautiful thing was that everyone was telling the truth. The councillor really didn't know about the 2012 meeting. The 2012 meeting really had happened. The plan really was being implemented. Nobody was really in charge of implementing it.\n\n\nSomehow, a decision made by people who didn't officially exist was being executed by people who officially couldn't stop it.\nThis allows him to be simultaneously the protector of services and the person closing services - a remarkable administrative innovation.\n\n\n## Chapter 9: Democracy 2.0 - Now With Less Democracy\n\n\nBut the system's crowning achievement is happening right now. **This month - July 2025 - Ealing Council is rewriting the petition rules** in direct response to successful community campaigns.\n\n\nOn page 294 of their July 15, 2025 council [papers](https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g6611/Public%20reports%20pack%20Tuesday%2015-Jul-2025%2019.00%20Council.pdf?T=10) [pdf, see p. 294], you can see democracy being crossed out in real time. They're removing:\n- Residents' rights to ask follow-up questions\n- Requirements for senior officers to give evidence  \n- Meaningful participation in debates about their own petitions\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/8439aacef6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"347\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: The document contains redlined text showing revisions related to the procedures for responding to petitions and presenting debates before the Council.\">\n\n\nThey've solved the democracy problem by removing the democratic bits from democracy. \n\n\nThe timing is perfect: after communities proved they could win by building independent pressure (Save Southall Young Adult Centre, Save Southall Town Hall, Save Warren Farm Nature Reserve), the council is changing the rules to prevent it happening again.\n\n\nSoon residents will be able to petition - they just won't be able to ask questions, get answers, or participate in discussions about their concerns.\n\n\nIt's democracy in name only, which is much more efficient than the old democracy where people could actually influence things.\n\n\n## Chapter 10: The Southall Young Adult Centre Miracle\n\n\nBut here's the thing - resistance is still possible. In 2022, the Council wanted to demolish Southall Young Adult Centre to build 60 flats. The usual process commenced: consultation theater, predetermined decisions, official helplessness.\n\n\nThen the \"Save Southall Young Adult Centre\" campaign launched. They didn't try to work within the impossible system. They built independent pressure. They refused to accept that \"decisions had been made.\"\n\n\nThey [won](https://www.visitsouthall.co.uk/News/NewsDetails.php?recordID=1235).\n\n\nThe centre was saved.\n\n\n\"How?\" Mrs. Patel asked.\n\n\n\"We stopped playing by their rules,\" the organisers said. \"We built power they couldn't ignore.\"\n\n\n## Chapter 11: The Impossible Solution\n\n\nMrs. Patel realized the children's centres could be saved the same way. But it would require doing something the system said was impossible: organising outside the official channels, building independent power, refusing to accept predetermined outcomes.\n\n\nThe Council had just changed the petition rules specifically to prevent another people-powered victory. But that only proved they were afraid of effective organising.\n\n\nThe system's weakness was its strength: it was so obviously absurd that anyone paying attention could see through it.\n\n\nThe Council Leader could tweet about putting \"people before buildings\" while closing buildings where people accessed services. He could claim to protect services while cutting them. He could represent diverse communities while excluding their political views. He could prioritize eels over children and call it environmentalism.\n\n\nAll of this was only possible because residents had been playing by rules designed to make them lose.\n\n\nBut the campaigns to save the Young Adult Centre, the Town Hall and Warren Farm proved the rules could be broken.\n\n\n## Chapter 12: The Choice\n\n\nMrs. Patel had a choice. She could continue navigating the impossible bureaucracy, filing petitions that couldn't ask questions, attending consultations about predetermined decisions, lobbying councillors who claimed to have no power.\n\n\nOr she could do what the other campaigners did: build independent power and refuse to accept defeat.\n\n\nThe children's centres could be saved. But only if parents stopped trying to reason with an unreasonable system and started building the power to change it.\n\n\nThe Council Leader would continue inhabiting his world of simultaneous contradictions, where closing centres meant protecting them and cutting services meant investing in communities.\n\n\nBut Mrs. Patel had learned something important: impossible things happen every day in Ealing politics.\n\n\nIf the Council Leader could be simultaneously progressive and regressive, protective and destructive, representative and exclusionary, then maybe Mrs. Patel could do something equally impossible.\n\n\nLike save a children's centre. \n\n\nThe Young Adult Centre campaigners had already shown it could be done.\n\n\nNow it was the children's centres' turn. \n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Even this right wing authoritarian Labour government thinks it's a [bad idea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvj1jr0kz0o) to close children's centres. \n\n## Chapter 13: The Engagement Paradox  \n\nThe Council Leader had perfected the art of simultaneous engagement.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b26d191a08.jpg\" width=\"496\" height=\"499\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A group of people holding protest signs gathers at night, with a tweet from Peter Mason about planning rules and community engagement.\">  \n\nHe could tweet about \"absolutely committed to engaging, listening and compromising\" while sharing photos of residents protesting his refusal to engage, listen, or compromise.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/117ce072a1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1020\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two social media posts promote a webinar and report launch about public engagement and planning for the future, by inviting people to join discussions on connected platforms.\">  \n\nHe spoke frequently about \"transparent engagement\" and \"finding the compromises everyone needs to make\" - usually while explaining why the compromises residents needed to make were accepting whatever he'd already decided.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/10069a5050.jpg\" width=\"496\" height=\"386\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet mentions a public meeting about Ealing's Local Plan, focusing on growth, priorities, challenges, and future planning.\">  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7e95b424b9.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"474\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses the goal of campaigning and highlights that Twitter is often a zero-sum game.\">\n\nEven councillors who were \"most responsive\" resigned rather than \"effectively endorse his toxic brand of politics.\"  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/76b65af2ac.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"565\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet expresses disappointment over a local councillor's resignation due to opposition to a colleague's political approach.\">  \n\nBut the real innovation was tweeting \"Welcome to Dystopia\" while creating it.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/4264ddab3e.jpg\" width=\"496\" height=\"624\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses the limits of conservative populism and the exploitation of rhetoric, with a highlighted quote on the consequences for demagogues.\">  \n\n## Chapter 14: The Investment Paradox \n\n\nThe Council Leader had achieved something remarkable: he could simultaneously remember genocide while investing in it. \"Remember Yesterday, Act Today,\" his council posted about the genocide of 8,732 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica thirty years ago, while [investing £112 million](https://lgpsdivest.org/lgps-investments/) in companies enabling genocide of [more than 28,000 women and girls](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/news/2025/05/un-women-estimates-over-28000-women-and-girls-killed-in-gaza-since-october-2023) in Gaza today. [More than 50,000 children killed or injured](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unimaginable-horrors-more-50000-children-reportedly-killed-or-injured-gaza-strip) in Gaza to pay for his pension. \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/d7a8763427.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"822\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: White tombstones in a cemetery are shown in a tweet about Srebrenica Memorial Day, which marks the genocide's 30th anniversary.\">\n\nIt was beautifully efficient. Why limit yourself to one genocide when you could remember one while funding another? The children understood perfectly.\n\n\nEqually impressive was his ability to close children's centres for budget reasons while sitting on the board as a [paid director](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/opdc_2020.21_audited_annual_report_and_accounts.pdf) [pdf] of a corporation that had just received £140 million in public funding. The logic was flawless: children's services were unaffordable, but corporate development was essential.\n\n\nThe Council Leader had mastered the art of proportional response. Children's centres closing to save £750,000? Budget pressures, difficult decisions, no choice. Sitting on the board overseeing \"one of the biggest regeneration schemes in Europe\" with £140 million in funding? That was worth £2,000 a year of his valuable time. \n\n\nIt was a masterclass in priorities: Europe's biggest regeneration project required his oversight, but Southall's children's centres were an unaffordable luxury. \n\n\nHe could simultaneously claim there was no money for community services while helping to plan a \"[mini-Manhattan](https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/fresh-pictures-reveal-what-london-22320564)\" in his own borough. The vision was clear: 54-storey towers, yes. Children's centres, no.\n\n\nHe'd found the perfect balance: cut services locally to save money, earn money regionally to oversee developers' profits. It was like a perpetual motion machine of fiscal responsibility.\n\n\n## Chapter and Verse: The Evolution of Enlightenment\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/401141c2e5.jpg\" width=\"579\" height=\"697\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A social media post humorously discusses attending a meeting where Punjabi is spoken, with a suggestion to nod and interject occasionally.\">\n\n\nIn 2010, our future Council Leader shared his frustration about \"sitting around not understanding all this punjabi\" at community meetings in the area he would later represent. \n\n\nBy 2020, he had evolved. \"Words have consequences,\" he tweeted. \"Impact is as important as intent. Culture is defined by leadership.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7db676b2d0.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"682\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Twitter post emphasizes the importance of learning lessons about the consequences of words, the significance of impact, leadership in culture, and the possibility of redemption, encouraging reflection or change.\">\n\n\nTen years of personal growth had taught him that words matter. Which made it remarkable that he could simultaneously lecture about cultural sensitivity while closing community centres in the same diverse communities he'd once struggled to understand. It was a masterclass in progressive evolution: you could acknowledge that words have consequences while ensuring your own words from the past had none.\n\n\n## Disclaimer \n\n\nReaders who think this is all a bit unfair, unbelievable, unhelpful or downright unlawful...\n\n\nThe most revealing evidence of how the system works came from inside the machine itself. In 2022, [leaked WhatsApp messages](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hZfSB-RR7OzeCIHclKdiJd_FTnUtT7KA/view?usp=drivesdk) [pdf] from the Ealing Labour councillors' group chat revealed what they really thought about their leadership.\n\n\nMason's own Labour colleagues called the Council Leader \"callous, ruthless, sectarian.\" \n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/c0b6a01f21.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A group chat conversation appears on a phone screen, discussing leadership support and political opinions, with messages from multiple participants.\">\n\n\nThey discussed votes of no confidence, referenced \"corruption and even theft\" regarding the previous leader, and debated \"bribes\" and \"rewards\" for loyalty. Meanwhile, publicly, they maintained perfect unity and collective responsibility. It was the perfect illustration of how the system works: private recognition of the problems, public performance of harmony. \n\n\nMrs. Patel understood perfectly. The same councillors who privately criticised authoritarian leadership accepted Mason's cabinet positions and pay rises to sit in silent support during council meetings.The leaked messages proved Mrs. Patel wasn't imagining the contradictions - even the people inside the system could see them.

Bell was too busy, it seemed, living in Paris, and employing his family not to answer phone calls at his parliamentary office. Worse, his son stole £8,000 worth of stuff from Bell's parliamentary colleagues, eventually serving sixty days in prison for the privilege.\n\nDespite this record of failure, Bell was duly elected again, with Walsh coming in third behind the newly Nick Clegg-revitalised Lib Dems. \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/pxl-20220416-095839241.mp.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person wearing a hat and sunglasses is holding a flyer in front of a palm tree and sidewalk.\">\n\nLast year, I had my own attempt to counter what I (and many others) saw as corruption, lies, hypocrisy and general incompetence of our local elected councillors.

				"content_html": "<p>Ealing Council&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7039/ealing_council_air_quality_strategy_2020-30\">draft Air Quality Strategy</a> is a 64 page document together with a 40 page <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7038/ealing_draft_air_quality_action_plan_2022-2027\">Action Plan</a>, and the consultation period runs until 30 January 2023. It&rsquo;s taken me the best part of six weeks, all my spare time over Christmas and New Year, to get through it all, make notes and cross-reference to try to make sense of it all and offer some feedback.</p>\n<p>Really, there must be a much longer consultation period if Ealing Council is genuinely interested in residents' views.</p>\n<p>The following is a summary of what the key points of interest are for me, and in particular in relation to Southall, where I live and work.

I am just an ordinary resident living in the midst of four major industrial and construction site polluters for several years. I have campaigned alongside my family, neighbours and friends for clean air after my then nearly four year old said he wanted fresh air not stinky air. He&rsquo;d been hospitalised three times when he was two and diagnosed with asthma.

The Council must question if it is ethical to promote active travel in Southall when it knows that it is a high pollution area and that most of its population is particularly vulnerable to its adverse health impacts.</strong></p>\n<p>The draft strategy and action plan don&rsquo;t do this at all.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"clean-air-for-ealing\">Clean Air for Ealing!</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/3141352312.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy&rsquo;s vision: clean air for all Ealing residents\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents\"></p>\n<p><em>To begin, I think it’s fantastic that Ealing Council has stated its vision for clean air for all Ealing residents, in alignment with that of local residents’ campaign group <a href=\"https://southallandhayescleanair.org.uk/about/\" title=\"About page for campaign group Clean Air for Southall and Hayes\">Clean Air for Southall and Hayes</a> (CASH).</em></p>\n<p><em>CASH has been <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/cleanair-for-southall-and-hayes-stop-berkeleygroupuk-s-southallwaterside-polluting-our-kids-southalllivesmatter\" title=\"Link to Change.org petition started by CASH in 2018\">asking for clean air for residents in Southall and Hayes since 2018</a>.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/feee9005e2.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of CASH&rsquo;s About page stating: we are a community group fighting for our right to breathe clean air\" title=\"Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a community group fighting for our right to breathe clean air\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"summary-of-the-strategy-and-action-plan\">Summary of the Strategy and Action Plan</h2>\n<p>Ealing&rsquo;s draft air quality strategy&rsquo;s five stated priorities are to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce road traffic emissions</li>\n<li>Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning</li>\n<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments</li>\n<li>Invest in green infrastructure</li>\n<li>Raise awareness of air quality</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>It would be useful to see the strategy and action plan follow the same structure with clear definitions of terms, and specific and detailed aims and objectives for each priority, along with baseline air pollution levels and equalities data for each in order to monitor and measure impact.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/1629717036.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport\"></p>\n<p>Somewhat confusingly, the action plan groups its actions into six categories:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Emissions from Developments and Buildings</li>\n<li>Public health and awareness raising</li>\n<li>Delivery servicing and freight</li>\n<li>Borough fleet actions</li>\n<li>Localised solutions</li>\n<li>Cleaner transport</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>This maybe because they are copied and pasted from the previous <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/4240/air_quality_action_plan_aqap\">2017-22 action plan</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>It would be better for understanding, monitoring and evaluation to have consistency and coherence between the two documents, updating the action plan where necessary to reflect this.</strong></p>\n<p>Also somewhat confusingly, Ealing&rsquo;s draft air quality strategy has nine stated goals, starting with the obvious. I&rsquo;ll say more on these later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve air quality</li>\n<li>Tackling the climate crisis</li>\n<li>Fighting inequality</li>\n<li>Protect biodiversity</li>\n<li>Protect health and wellbeing</li>\n<li>Raise public awareness</li>\n<li>Promote sustainable infrastructure</li>\n<li>Support the transition to clean energy</li>\n<li>Creating good jobs</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"inequalities\">Inequalities</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/17f94db6cd.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\"></p>\n<p><em>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk in Ealing&rsquo;s air quality strategy about being inclusive and &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; (&ldquo;reducing&rdquo; would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; (&ldquo;exhaust trail&rdquo; might be more apt?). I&rsquo;m not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"public-health-policy\">Public Health Policy</h3>\n<p>The strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks.</p>\n<p><em>When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action</a>), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we&rsquo;ll see later, promoting active travel.</em></p>\n<p>In contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio</a>).</p>\n<p>*There&rsquo;s obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Good Growth</a>), and social policy (<a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Tackling Inequalities</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.</strong></p>\n<p>The strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced.

Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council&rsquo;s response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn&rsquo;t give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Wouldn&rsquo;t this be fantastic?! Again, the Council&rsquo;s response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents' needs for clean air first, and above developers' desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Invest in green infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Southall has the least <a href=\"https://www.ealingitree.online/stories/canopy-cover/0\" title=\"Tree canopy cover in Ealing\">tree canopy cover in Ealing</a>, yet is subjected to <a href=\"https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns\" title=\"Over-development of Southall\">massive overdevelopment</a>.

Having sat on the Mayor&rsquo;s money and done nothing for so long it&rsquo;s no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new &lsquo;pocket park&rsquo; outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-&lsquo;orchards&rsquo; planted in existing parks, instead.

My guess would be not many more than 1,000 in total, most will be repeaters (thinking GP referrals, lots of organisers?). If it&rsquo;s helped 1,000 individuals, that&rsquo;s £5,400 per person.

The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. <strong>Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/8be373b743.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don&rsquo;t reduce air pollution\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution\"></p>\n<p>b. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. <strong>Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.</strong></p>\n<p>c.

				"content_text": "Ealing Council's [draft Air Quality Strategy][1] is a 64 page document together with a 40 page [Action Plan][2], and the consultation period runs until 30 January 2023. It's taken me the best part of six weeks, all my spare time over Christmas and New Year, to get through it all, make notes and cross-reference to try to make sense of it all and offer some feedback. \n\nReally, there must be a much longer consultation period if Ealing Council is genuinely interested in residents' views.\n\nThe following is a summary of what the key points of interest are for me, and in particular in relation to Southall, where I live and work. My additional suggestions are **in bold**, and my comments and questions in *italics*.\n\n#### Warning\n\nThis is a LONG post. I've tried to break it into sections to make it easier to read.\n\n#### Disclaimer \n\n*I don't claim to be an expert, other than through experience. I am just an ordinary resident living in the midst of four major industrial and construction site polluters for several years. I have campaigned alongside my family, neighbours and friends for clean air after my then nearly four year old said he wanted fresh air not stinky air. He'd been hospitalised three times when he was two and diagnosed with asthma. We soon discovered people who had lost loved ones, had heart attacks, ectopic pregnancies, cancer, all attributed to the foul petrochemical stink.*\n\n*I welcome any corrections.*\n\n# My Summary\n\n**If Ealing is serious about \"fighting\" inequalities, action must be targeted to protect vulnerable people in Southall to reduce air pollution and its impact on the health of its large, mostly economically deprived and non-white population.**\n\n**The Strategy and Plan must target children and older people, people with lung conditions, and pregnant women: outside schools and school run hours. The Council must question if it is ethical to promote active travel in Southall when it knows that it is a high pollution area and that most of its population is particularly vulnerable to its adverse health impacts.**\n\nThe draft strategy and action plan don't do this at all.\n\n---\n\n# Clean Air for Ealing!\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/3141352312.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents\")\n\n*To begin, I think it’s fantastic that Ealing Council has stated its vision for clean air for all Ealing residents, in alignment with that of local residents’ campaign group [Clean Air for Southall and Hayes][3] (CASH).*\n\n*CASH has been [asking for clean air for residents in Southall and Hayes since 2018][4].*\n\n![Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a community group fighting for our right to breathe clean air](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/feee9005e2.jpg \"Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a community group fighting for our right to breathe clean air\")\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the Strategy and Action Plan\n\nEaling's draft air quality strategy's five stated priorities are to:\n\n> - Reduce road traffic emissions\n> - Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning\n> - Reduce emissions from construction of new developments\n> - Invest in green infrastructure\n> - Raise awareness of air quality\n\n**It would be useful to see the strategy and action plan follow the same structure with clear definitions of terms, and specific and detailed aims and objectives for each priority, along with baseline air pollution levels and equalities data for each in order to monitor and measure impact.**\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/1629717036.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport\")\n\nSomewhat confusingly, the action plan groups its actions into six categories: \n\n> - Emissions from Developments and Buildings\n> - Public health and awareness raising\n> - Delivery servicing and freight\n> - Borough fleet actions\n> - Localised solutions\n> - Cleaner transport\n\n*This maybe because they are copied and pasted from the previous [2017-22 action plan][5].*\n\n**It would be better for understanding, monitoring and evaluation to have consistency and coherence between the two documents, updating the action plan where necessary to reflect this.**\n\nAlso somewhat confusingly, Ealing's draft air quality strategy has nine stated goals, starting with the obvious. I'll say more on these later:\n\n> 1. Improve air quality\n> 2. Tackling the climate crisis\n> 3. Fighting inequality\n> 4. Protect biodiversity\n> 5. Protect health and wellbeing\n> 6. Raise public awareness\n> 7. Promote sustainable infrastructure\n> 8. Support the transition to clean energy\n> 9. Creating good jobs\n\n---\n\n### Inequalities \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/17f94db6cd.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\")\n\n*There's a lot of talk in Ealing's air quality strategy about being inclusive and \"fighting\" (\"reducing\" would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution \"footprint\" (\"exhaust trail\" might be more apt?). I'm not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.*\n\n---\n\n### Public Health Policy\n\nThe strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks. \n\n*When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the [Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action][6]), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we'll see later, promoting active travel.*\n\nIn contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing's [Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio][6]).\n\n*There's obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or [Good Growth][6]), and social policy ([Tackling Inequalities][6]). \n\n**It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.**\n\nThe strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant. \n\n*Ealing's [Health Profile from 2019][7] puts that figure in some context:*\n\n![Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/35109e01b4.jpg \"Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\")\n\n---\n\n## Air Pollution in Ealing\n\n### Pollution Sources \n\nThe strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy. \n\nThose most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women. \n\n**It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution \"hotspots\", especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).** \n\n*I don't believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.*\n\nThe strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.\n\n*Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).*\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/adc0267e1f.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\")\n\n*On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):*\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/12c505256e.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\")\n\n*In the graphics from the 2017-22 action plan, wood burning doesn't get a look-in at all, data from 2013.* \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f0df8bd46e.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\")\n\n**It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.**\n\n*The good news is that road traffic emissions, the council's key action area for 2022-30, reduced significantly in Ealing between 2013 and 2019.* \n\n**It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.**\n\n---\n\n### Air Quality Monitoring \n\nThe strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/0996242a03.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\")\n\n*It's worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the [background levels of PM2.5][8] in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO's target.*\n\nThe draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.\n\nEaling has 67 air quality monitors across the borough, all recording levels of nitrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulate matter (PM10 only). \n\n*It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although there are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as [The Green Quarter][9].*\n\nEaling publishes annual air quality [status reports][10].\n\n*Ealing also has [an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites][11] where you can see graphical annual data summary charts. Unfortunately, none seem to have been updated since 2021.*\n\n![Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/58dfd151de.jpg \"Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021\") \n\n**It would be useful to have more monitors for particulate matter, especially PM2.5, across the borough, and in Southall, and for published data from all air pollution monitors to be kept accessible and up-to-date.**\n\n---\n\n## Priorities for Action\n\nBack to the strategy's priorities for action, and my *comments and questions*, and **suggestions**.\n\n> - Reduce road traffic emissions. \n\n*The biggest reduction in road traffic emissions came during 2020 covid lockdowns, and while it's not practical, feasible or desirable to replicate that going forward, it might be worth promoting the idea that employers should encourage and support an increase to the 36% of Ealing's working age population already mainly [working from home][12] whenever possible, as opposed to the current political groupthink that everyone must return to the office in order to be productive.*\n\n> - Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning. \n\n*There are two wood-burning incinerators close to my home, which frequently create disgusting burning plastic odours forcing us to stay indoors and close all our windows. Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council's response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn't give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.*\n\n> - Reduce emissions from construction of new developments. \n\n*Wouldn't this be fantastic?! Again, the Council's response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents' needs for clean air first, and above developers' desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?*\n\n> - Invest in green infrastructure. \n\n*Southall has the least [tree canopy cover in Ealing][13], yet is subjected to [massive overdevelopment][14]. This almost entirely terraced town is being transformed into a new Manhattan.* \n\n*The one concession negotiated hard by our elected representatives, and granted by the London Mayor for overruling local democracy to allow the Gasworks development, was to widen the South Road bridge by the train station to ease the often gridlocked road. Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the 'reset' button. Having sat on the Mayor's money and done nothing for so long it's no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new 'pocket park' outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-'orchards' planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the 'Poison Park' to look forward to, the 'green space' crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.*\n\n**If the council's air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.** \n\n*Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a 'compromise' to [destroy most of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall][15] in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don't want. I don't understand how the Leader's desires complement the Council's stated strategies to reduce air pollution, tackle the climate emergency they declared, and to protect and promote biodiversity and our ecosystem.*\n\n- Raise awareness of air quality. \n\n*The council also wants to (and must) lead by example.* \n\n**If the council really wants to lead by example on reducing air pollution, then the council Leader cannot accept or request car rides to or from meetings in Southall, councillors cannot park in cycle lanes in Southall, nor fly to the property developer festival in the south of France. They must engage with Southall residents suffering the worst of the air pollution from multiple sources, and stop denying or minimising the existence and extent of the problems, and proactively and collaboratively work to reduce or stop such pollution episodes continuing.** \n\n*Otherwise, the council's strategy isn't worth the virtual paper it's printed on, and is just more hot air.*\n\n*What we have in the draft plan, however, is largely a copy-and-paste of the previous 2017-2022 plan, which was, at worst, a demonstrable failure of ambition, leadership and political will, and, at best, a simple failure of the council to do what it said it would do.*\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Goals\n\n> 1. Improve air quality. Protect the health and wellbeing of Ealing residents from the harmful effects\n> of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) air pollution. \n\n**The strategy MUST have the inclusive goal of protecting residents from the harmful effects of ALL air pollutants (not just nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter).**.\n\n> 2. Tackling the climate crisis.... by aiming for the highest environmental standards. \n\n**The \"highest environmental standards\" must be clearly stated and defined.**\n\n> 3. Fighting inequality.... to ensure that no-one is left behind... [and] residents feel safe. \n\n**The strategy must ensure that inequalities are reduced, that ALL residents are included in this process, and that their concerns for the safety of their air are taken seriously and acted upon.** *Promoting the uptake of expensive electric vehicles and discounting parking spaces for them is discriminating against economically deprived mostly non-white people who suffer most from air pollution.*\n\n> 4. Protect biodiversity. Ensuring our parks, open spaces and nature are protected and enhanced. \n\n*This is particularly relevant right now, as the Council Leader pushes on with his undemocratic desire to destroy much of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall, and killing off a quarter of London's endangered skylarks, in order to build new sports pitches and/or a football stadium.*\n\n> 5. Protect health and wellbeing. Protecting and enhancing the physical and mental health of all. \n\n*Except in Southall? [Public Health England's four risk assessment reports][16] into the Southall Gasworks poisoning clearly stated that \"Odours can cause nuisance amongst the population possibly leading to stress and anxiety. Some people may experience symptoms such as nausea, headaches or dizziness.\"*\n\n> 6. Raise public awareness. Promoting awareness of the causes and impacts of air quality issues, as well as the available local solutions.... encouraging community activism.... \n\n*Except in Southall? At every opportunity, Ealing Council has sought to erase, deny or minimise the causes and impacts of air quality issues related to Southall Gasworks, refused to enforce any local solutions, and actively discouraged and attempted to prevent community activists' voices from being heard.*\n\n> 7. Promote sustainable infrastructure. Ensure local transport and development planning supports investment in sustainable infrastructure, that limits impact on air quality, enabling a shift to low-emission transport and energy options. \n\n*Except in Southall? The Council recently [decided NOT to widen the South Road bridge in Southall][17]. Widening the bridge, as promised, would ease congestion, and improve air quality, public transport and active travel options. The bridge widening was the one concession granted to the Southall community when the London Mayor overruled local democracy to give the go ahead to development of the highly contaminated Southall Gasworks site.*\n\n> 8. Support the transition to clean energy. Supporting the uptake of low-emission energy technologies and improvements in efficiencies, and reducing reliance on the consumption of fossil and solid fuels. \n\n*Like [in Chile][18]? Simply promoting and encouraging more (low emission) cars isn’t going to reduce congestion, emissions from brake and tyre wear, or help to reduce our “reliance on the consumption of fossil fuels”. Ealing [reportedly doesn’t have enough power on the electricity grid for new homes until 2030][19].* \n\n> 9. Creating good jobs. We want to... deliver an ambitious programme of building more genuinely affordable homes. \n\n*Ealing is [building fewer genuinely affordable homes than ever][20], and [making the housing crisis in Ealing worse][21] by [demolishing more social rent homes][22] than it is building.*\n\n---\n\n## Spotlight on Southall \n\nThese are all my comments, so I'm not putting it all in *italics.*\n\nMy suggestions and questions for the strategy are still in **bold.**\n\n**Southall cannot be used as a good example of how Ealing Council takes air pollution seriously.** \n\n### Inequalities\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b507cd1558.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people\") \n\nSouthall has a [BAME population of more than 90%][23].\n\nSouthall Broadway/West and Southall Green are the two council wards that border the old Gasworks site, and which are downwind from the FM Conway asphalt and Tarmac plants, and the two wood-burning incinerators, depending on wind direction. They are connected by the Gasworks site and by the Air Quality Focus Area from South Road to The Green, King Street and Western Road.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/620d0a35d2.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites\")\n\nSouthall is already a high pollution area (and an Air Quality Focus Area as a result), but has several additive sources of unmitigated, uncontrolled air pollution.\n\nEconomically poorer, BAME people, children, older people and pregnant women are the most vulnerable to the health impacts of toxic air pollution. Certainly not a fairer start for Southall’s children.\n\nWe know from bitter experience over the last six years in Southall that the council has failed in its duty to protect some of its most vulnerable residents from harm.\n\n### Raising Awareness\n\nTo add insult to injury, the council failed to raise public awareness of the risks and the air quality monitoring data in an open and transparent manner before work on the site began, and while the work was in progress. It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”. Residents were never informed if, when or how levels of naphthalene were urgently reduced.\n\n![Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7ee1493a47.jpg \"Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment\")\n\nIt’s noteworthy that the Council claims it asked PHE to get involved only [“following concerns raised by local residents”][24] and not because the Council itself carried out an Equalities Impact Assessment prior to works starting in 2016, knowing that the Southall population was significantly more vulnerable to air pollution due to high pre-existing levels and multiple inequalities.\n\nSimilarly, the council says it responded to residents' concerns by installing \"independent\" air quality monitors on site in 2021, but this is five years after the work started, and two years after the main source of air pollution and odour complaints (the so-called soil \"hospital\") was decommissioned. The monitors now installed record near-real time data for “urban background” emissions of odourless particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/76615b310f.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns\")\n\nThe odours and air pollution that residents are concerned about originate from polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (i.e., the hundred years’ of toxic waste from town gas, coal tar and petrochemical work sites). We are told that there are diffusion tubes monitoring these emissions, but there is a total lack of openness and transparency as to their locations and the data they have recorded. The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!\n\n### Public Health\n\nWe are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. **Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?** The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?\n\nMoreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years' of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and \"cleaned\" in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. **Why wasn't truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?**\n\n### Enforcement\n\nWhy didn't the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?\n\nThe council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks. Indeed half of the plan was missing from the planning portal and [the council admitted that it didn't have a full copy of the original CMP][25]. \n\n**How on earth was the council planning to enforce a CMP it wasn’t in possession of?** This was a gross dereliction of duty to care for the health and wellbeing of (by its own definition) the most vulnerable residents in the borough.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/43138639f4.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites\")\n\n**The Council was committed to full enclosure of waste sites in its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan. Why wasn’t the one hundred years of petrochemical waste \"soil cleaning hospital” enclosed?**\n\n[National Grid have enclosed their enclosed their soil remediation work][26] specifically to avoid causing odour nuisance to the local community (and thanks no doubt to campaigning by local residents and activists at Clean Air for Southall and Hayes).\n\n### On Whose Side?\n\nWhy did the former and current council leader [accept over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group][27] to fly (!) to the south of France for what Private Eye Magazine describes as [a booze and hookerfest][28]?\n\nThe new council leader claims he went there to negotiate hard. If that's the case, what did he negotiate? He also claimed that it wasn't what he expected and that it was a mistake to go. If that's also the case, [why was it a mistake][29]?\n\n**How can we be sure that the new council leader and his administration won't continue making these mistakes and taking the side of developers rather than standing up for the residents they are elected to represent?**\n\n### Local  Action\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/726113aef4.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response\")\n\n**If the soil is now clean and the air is safe to breathe, why would stopping works during hot weather (which didn’t happen in 2018), and covering stockpiles (why weren’t they covered already?) be given as examples of possible mitigating actions?**\n\n**There must be a new commitment to work with and for residents where these are issues. Air pollution and odour nuisance reporting and investigation procedures need to be overhauled as they are currently not fit for purpose (reporting process too convoluted, each one investigated as a single, isolated incident rather than as part of an ongoing problem, residents are simply not believed and our reports are minimised and invalidated).** \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/2cf1bdd0de.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality\")\n\n**Work on the Gasworks site is due to complete in 2038. Why is the date for net-zero emissions set for twelve years after this date in 2050?**\n\nThere's a similar commitment to target zero-emissions for construction vehicles by 2040, which is two years after the new draft local Plan period for new developments ends. \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/4843e8295e.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers\")\n\n**What has Ealing Council done to date to campaign for greater regulatory powers and for a Clean Air Act? Please give examples.**\n\nThis draft Air Quality Strategy is fine in many respects in terms of the words it contains, but what concerns me is that these are empty words if they are not acted on and enforced.\n\nRecent history strongly suggests the council doesn't have the leadership, organisational culture or political will to act in the interests of its most vulnerable residents in Southall.\n\n### Active Travel\n\nThere's a lot of talk about active travel and Ealing Council's multi-million pound Let's Go Southall campaign in the draft Strategy, but [very little on its real cost and impact][31]. They seem to have about 50 regular weekly activity groups. Over two years that's 5,000 sessions. 30,000 attendances (not individuals). So average of six people per session? 1,000 people attended at least two sessions (repeat attendances). My guess would be not many more than 1,000 in total, most will be repeaters (thinking GP referrals, lots of organisers?). If it's helped 1,000 individuals, that's £5,400 per person. If 10,000 it's £540 per person (still seems like a lot of money). And there's no evidence that it's helped anyone! \n\n**The council must be open and transparent with residents that Let's Go Southall is a top-down neoliberal behavioural change (\"nudge theory\") programme led by a retired stockbroker, and not the \"grassroots social movement\" of the council's Orwellian publicity.**\n\n**If the Council is serious about improving safe active travel options in Southall, then it must improve road and pavement conditions and safety first. Many of the roads and pavements are not fit to cycle or walk on, especially for children and families, older people, and people with disabilities.**\n\n---\n\n# Air Quality Action Plan\n\n## The 2017-2022 Action Plan\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f573809dce.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution\")\n\na. Included a number of no-or-low-impact schemes such as Low Emission Neighbourhoods (LENs), implemented in 2021 as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. **Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?**\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/8be373b743.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution\")\n\nb. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. **Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.**\n\nc. Another low impact scheme was Play Streets. **How many Play Streets are there now? How often do they run? Where are they?**\n\nd. **How many Pocket Parks are there? Where are they?**\n\ne. **How many Green Screens  are there? Where are they? Why were green screens not erected at Southall Gasworks even after residents complained of dust from the site in their homes?**\n\nf. **How are these schemes evaluated in terms of reducing air pollution? Where are the air quality monitors located to record baseline measurements to compare against air pollution levels during or after the scheme is in place?**\n\ng. **Enforcement of anti-idling laws was deemed \"not cost-effective\". Smoke control was not deemed a problem and therefore not promoted or enforced. Who made these decisions?**\n\nh. **What is the wider 'cost' to residents in not taking enforcement action against these criminal behaviours?**\n\n## The 2022-2027 Action Plan (AQAP)\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/73f624c5da.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone\")\n\n**If air pollution monitoring data cannot inform the efficacy of individual actions, how can it be used in combination with secondary data to do so?** I'm sure there must be a sensible explanation, but to most people I suspect this statement makes little sense. In Southall, we have continuously been asked to ignore our own lived experience of health and quality of life problems attributed to the open-air 'cleaning' of a hundred years of petrochemical waste at the Gasworks site, in favour of the developer Berkeley's assurances that it's own monitoring of air quality is 'within acceptable limits' and harmless to health. Public Health England published four risk assessments based on Berkeley's data, and came to similar conclusions, although neither looked at any secondary data. The air pollution data has still to be published so that the public can make up their own minds.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b26fce3d39.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution\")\n\n![](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/a5185741a3.jpg)\n\nI'm not sure how imperceptible changes that cannot be detected by monitoring or modelling can be interpreted as Low Impact or a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Action Plan here seems to contradict the Strategy by stating that changes in the levels of air pollution above a certain level can be attributed even to individual actions (although more likely to be due to multiple actions).\n\n**If the council is serious about using air pollution data and secondary data to establish efficacy of its air quality strategy and action plan, (which sounds sensible enough), then it must explain what measures it will use, and publish baseline data and regular updates.** \n\nLike it does with its [performance dashboard][30].  \n  \nLooking at the Council's own evaluation of its 2017-22 Action Plan, I would suggest that its achievements are minimal, and misleading.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/6aa8ea88ed.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan\")\n\nElectric Vehicle charging points (p. 30 of 2022 AQAP) were not actually a specified target in the 2017 AQAP, so I'm unsure how this can be claimed as an achievement? Similarly with School Streets and specific cycle lanes. LENS/LTNs were specified as a target, but there is no mention of that fiasco here. **Air quality monitoring data must be used to locate pollution hotspots for any future implementation of LENs/LTNs**\n\nThe 20 mph speed limit was implemented borough-wide, but only since December 2021. Why did it take so long? What is the use of it if it isn’t enforced, especially in Southall?  \n  \n[1]: https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7039/ealing_council_air_quality_strategy_2020-30\n\n[2]:

Ever!</p>\n\n<p>Ealing Council Leader Julian Bell publicly blamed 'the wrong kind of wind', and – quite possibly – privately blamed 'fucking moaners'. All the while racking up over £30,000 in declared gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group, who were digging up the gasworks land.</p>\n\n<p>Our soon-to-be local ward councillor and (ex-)Head of Planning Peter Mason knew all about the dangers (he tells us on Twitter) from the contaminated land back in 2009 when he campaigned against its development along with our MP Virendra Sharma (who said the development would be 'a disaster environmentally').</p>\n\n<p>Yet no one told people living nearby to expect to be gassed in our own homes and gardens during the three month heatwave that was shortly to arrive.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Ealing Council announced on Twitter that the odours, while 'unpleasant', were 'not harmful to health' would be 'gone in a few days'.</p>\n\n<p>I later discovered that there is scientific evidence that some people with Asian and African heritages are genetically more vulnerable to very serious and sometimes fatal health conditions from inhaling naphthalene, a fact acknowledged (although later denied, despite the published evidence) by Public Health England at a packed public meeting in July 2019.</p>\n\n<p>No one told us.</p>\n\n<p>Ealing Council, despite being fully aware of the potential dangers to health (and to the environment) failed to carry out any kind of Equalities Impact Assessment, and only helped Berkeley Group to rush through the decontamination process to maximise their profit from Crossrail in Southall.</p>\n\n<p>Profit over people. Labour Council. Our lives didn't matter to them.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we are being asked to believe that our MP (who has begun making the right noises two years too late – what happened to the nearly 1,000 signature petition I gave you in 2018 Mr Sharma?) cares and is on our side, and that our local ward councillor cares and always has done. Only Bell is – unusually for him – honest enough not to suddenly pretend he gives a shit about anyone but himself and looking after his own family.</p>\n\n<p>At the packed public meeting in 2019, which our local ward councillor chaired, he and Bell refused to declare their financial interests with Berkeley Group, refused to let me speak with the microphone so that people couldn't hear that the Council, Berkeley Group, the Environment Agency and Public Health England had all colluded to cover up the real level of toxic and carcinogenic air pollution – that it was consistently above legal limits and rising – by manipulating, removing, and presenting the air quality data in such a way as to make it look like it was mostly within legal limits.</p>\n\n<p>At the same meeting, our MP arrived late, mostly unseen, sat silently at the back of the room, and left early, mostly unseen.\nAt the same meeting, a strangely truthful Bell admitted that he had 'known about the nuisance, the BAD nuisance, for two and a half years'! Yet nothing could be done.</p>\n\n<p>Now Peter Mason, free from his constraints as Head of Planning after resigning following his failed coup attempt to take the leadership from Bell last year, is telling us that something could and should have been done, yet all of them remained silent and did nothing for years.</p>\n\n<p>Unbelievable!</p>\n",

He sneaked in, sat at the back mostly unseen by anyone there, and then left early.</p>\n\n<p>A bit like his time as an MP!</p>\n\n<p>So, at this meeting.</p>\n\n<p>We discovered that Asian and African people, the majority of people in Southall, are genetically more at risk from poisoning from naphthalene.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma have to say about that?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>For two years or more, Southallians have complained to Mr Sharma about the oppressive stink, and poison air, coming from the old gasworks site. I have suffered numerous chest infections, my wife had serious and severe health problems, and my young son has been hospitalised with asthma and now has to take steroids every day of his life so that he can breathe. I know neighbours whose loved ones have now got cancer, and some who have died from cancer. All, we believe, caused by the poison air.</p>\n\n<p>What has Mr Sharma done to help us?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, a group of us presented Mr Sharma with a petition signed by 900 Southallians and their families and friends begging Mr Sharma to do something to get Berkeley Group, the developer of the old gasworks site, to stop poisoning Southall.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma do?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, throughout the last couple of years, while his constituents in Southall Green have been poisoned by the toxic air from the old gasworks site, and getting ill with breathing problems, and cancer, the developer Berkeley Group has sponsored numerous local events, mainly to 'clean up' Southall.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma do?</p>\n\n<p>He attended every one and was photographed smiling broadly wearing his hi-viz jacket with the Berkeley Group logo emblazoned across it.</p>\n\n<p>So tonight, I'm voting in favour of the trigger ballot for Mr Sharma, so that we have the opportunity to have a new Labour MP for Ealing Southall, one who will stand up for local people rather than help those who oppress them.</p>\n\n<p>And I ask all of you to do the same.</p>\n\n<p>Solidarity!</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Sharma was triggered for reselection, but survived without having to stand again thanks to his old pal Boris Johnson, who called a general election shortly after.</p>\n",

[The final report](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1dIP7WF5MtN0KxDq2Nit0y6m10KRTFVw5%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dsharing%26fbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAYnJpZBEwUmlIVk1ndU5iSEhKVmZOTwEeCJL5knD4aQ2WwrVKRfYLnui5hyRjtTXdS7v_TyFMvcJ7_E_GHxaYtZ9GkG8_aem_FVPrGZce3P0P3s5QSOTZ3w&h=AT2QBlc2YZevXP51WikAz5AiQOhlyyflyDR5l2Td5ZuD_nZ_9bHjkK4vLKkwR2gEGnyKkcf4voRV9jnbL-9qsb0Y8ro5_TdfqdEopxPhlHSoSEOeMorS17EV_ZQ), for 2019, includes 4 weeks of data when the soil ‘hospital’ had closed, further diluting the data, and having the effect of further lowering the published averages.\n\n\n1. Since the soil ‘hospital’ closed, three new off-site monitors are located, one in Minet Park to the north-west of the site, and two in Randolph Road to the east, and behind several rows of houses. Again, including data from these sites further reduces the overall site average.\n\n\n1. The above is all highly unscientific, and again I wonder what was their motivation for doing this?\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/aspose.words.c69b4207-65d8-4102-b57d-6f5f36d36b17.011.jpg\" width=\"508\" height=\"301\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A detailed map shows fixed-site monitoring locations with directional arrows and additional notes for soil testing.\">\n\n\nLocations of additional on and off site air monitors\n\n\n\nThere’s probably other stuff I’ve missed, and I haven’t looked at the data from the other air monitors located near Blair Peach Primary School, or elsewhere.\n\n\nOne aspect of the Atkins weekly average data I noticed, that struck me as being odd, is that while levels of benzene and naphthalene varied quite wildly from week to week and between AIR1 (above) and ES14 monitors, readings for other chemicals are often exactly the same at the two locations and in some cases for consecutive weeks. Maybe that is possible, but it just seems to me unlikely, and therefore raises more doubts about the integrity and validity of what we have been told.\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/screenshot-20250924-193536.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A spreadsheet displays air quality data with various chemical compounds' concentrations highlighted in different colors.\">\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested, you can see my [Atkins spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C_qXz5cfpdAOL0KqH9n_V3ZRN-SytSFhHpgo3yrq5Vg/edit?usp=drivesdk).\n",

				"content_text": "## Any other comments about the effect the Southall Waterside redevelopment has had on your health?\n\n\n1. Worried about as yet unknown, unseen long-term impacts\n\n\n1. My house has been wrecked and the people who are working for Berkley are unable to listen to me and also the other neighbours \n\n1. every evening, our bathroom drain lets off STRONG odour. It is awful! the smell spreads around the whole house - opening the windows is not even an option! daily use bleach. The drain outside our house which is connected to the bathroom also is letting off the same odour.\n\n\n1. Stops me playing outside.\n\n\n1. It’s affecting my kids health too, we live on Trinity road which is right next to the waterside\n\n\n1. My House is full of dust and I have felt foundations of my house shaking and cracks emerging in walls\n\n\n1. MY HEALTH PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN SEVERE FOR 12 YEARS BUT THIS RECENT HEATWAVE ALONG WITH THE POLLUTION DIRECTLY PRODUCED BY THIS GASWORK REDEVELOPMENT HAS MADE ME SHOCKINGLY WORSE SINCE JUNE AND HAVE BEEN ILL ON A DAILY BASIS ON TOP OF MY EXISTING HEALTH ISSUES. LIFE HAS BEEN HELL AND YOU OFTEN CAN'T EVEN OPEN THE WINDOWS FOR FRESH AIR DURING THE EXCEPTIONALLY HOT WEATHER.\n\n\n1. Dust, noise, vibrations in the house\n\n\n1. my mental health is affected as it leaves me unable to open windows on a gloriously sunny day to enjoy fresh air. Also I cannot take my daughter to parks outdoors for long because she also suffers from the nausea she and I get from the stench and fumes. It has been driving our family insane. It has taken our freedom to enjoy the sunshine away! Stop it!!!!\n\n\n1. Shut the f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g thing down immediately. Doesn't appear that an effective risk assessment was carried out. Seems someone is putting profits before people.\n\n\n1. I have been closing my windows and scared to Breathe in the air in case I develop any itchiness\n1. I am usually in good health but I've now developed cold like symptoms when at home. I work in Hemel Hempstead and am always fine when I'm there.\n1. It has affected our life to the extent that we feel like we need to move out of Southall now, which will have huge cost and life implications\n1. I can only walk short distances without having to stop. I had no problem abroad and was climbing mountains with no problem. Two weeks back and the problems have started again.\n\n\n1. The air is toxic. I can only walk a few hundred yards without having the feeling of having a heart attack. My throat burns\n\n\n1. Cannot leave my house without breathing in poisonous air!\n\n\n\n## If you have suffered damage to your property, or think you might have, please describe below.\n\n\n1. Window frames in living room and bedroom are warped and no longer close properly after spending all summer having to open and close them repeatedly because of the awful stench, and the fear of letting toxic fumes into our home.\n\n1. Dust on windows, and car.\n\n\n1. Dust on windows, window frames no longer close properly due to opening and closing repeated due to odour and concerns about health.\n\n\n1. Walls have cracks and some things are coming out and the overall impact for the property has become very loose\n\n\n1. Windows and UVPC window frames need more frequent cleaning\n\n\n1. Cracks in the Ceiling\n\n\n1. our bath tub is green due to the continous bleach\n\n\n1. Temporary traﬃc lights on beaconsfield road made a big impact on our road and specially increase in traﬃc and digging roads(woodlands & beaconsfield) is making parking diﬃcult for us\n\n\n1. Smell and dust\n\n\n1. Cracks in walls in bedroom due to foundation shaking\n\n\n1. Cracks\n\n\n## Please describe your experience of reporting or complaining\n\n\n1. Waste of time\n\n\n1. Terrible.\n\n\n1. We have been asked to phone three separate numbers for each incident of odour nuisance and air pollution, it takes forever on the phone, no one seems to know what we are talking about, despite numerous previous complaints and reports. After all that, none of the agencies we have been told to report to actually do anything to make things better! They are useless and toothless, and Berkeley Group have treated us with utter contempt.\n\n\n1. Unsatisfactory\n\n\n1. Bad odour, have to close windows as it causes me to have a headache.\n\n\n1. Not helpful\n\n\n1. Had to close windows and doors during this very hot summer because of smell from both southall & conways double because I believe it's both places\n\n\n1. Does not seem to be an investigation into the issues raised\n\n\n1. They were not interested\n\n\n1. No positive answers or outcome.\n\n\n1. I phoned LBE Pollution Control Team.\n\n\n1. No reply\n\n\n1. No aswer back\n\n\n1. I LEFT DETAILED REPORT OF POLLUTION CAUSED AND THE ONGOING EFFECTS ON MY HEALTH AND WAS TOLD I WOULD RECEIVE A CALLBACK. I WAS CALLED BACK ONLY TO BE TOLD TO CONTACT THE GROUP UNDERTAKING THE BUILDING WORK AND RECEIVED NO OTHER HELP AT ALL.\n\n\n1. I complained about the terrible smell and horrendous amount of dust. I complained about the effect on my daughter's health.\n\n\n1. It's been diﬃcult if you ring Ealing Council they ask you to ring the Environment Agency and when you ring them they tell you to the ring the council, and vice versa, thus making you exhausted so you give up. Even if you write to them they have basically refused to take responsibility of any issues you have raised had an independent person be doing what Berkeley Group are doing they be held responsible and work stopped to establish safe levels!\n\n\n1. The smell of petrol at night preventing the openi6of windows then eye irritation all day.\n\n\n1. Has not resulted in positive outcomes\n\n\n1. No reply as of yet\n\n\n1. Very little being done.\n\n\n1. Councillors don't care and keep saying they looking into it.\n\n\n## Please describe any positive outcomes as a result of complaining or reporting\n\n19 responses\n\n\n1. None\n\n\n1. N/A\n\n\n1. Nil so far\n\n\n1. Meeting and getting to know better my neighbours.\n\n\n1. Nothing!\n\n\n1. No one from the authorities seems to care.\n\n\n1. Just take the complaint and give a reference number\n\n\n1. I don't know because council never take any suggestion with anything in the broughwith ﬂy tipping and going through things to see who is doing it so I am very disillusioned Hillingdon & All the council\n\n\n1. None\n\n\n1. The response from the Environmental Agency (North London and Hertfordshire) was somewhat dismissive. They basically said that the contractors are complying so we cant do anything.\n\n\n1. No reply - ignored\n\n\n1. Cut back foliage as requested\n\n\n1. finding others who have suffered\n\n\n1. Small measures taken by Berkely. They used more water to spray soil.\n\n\n\n\n## Do you have any suggestions for how the reporting or complaining process could be improved?\n\n14 responses\n\n\n1. There should be one reporting line, and it should be much easier to report e.g., via text, Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, or even the Ealing 24/7 app, although really that is far from ideal. The reporting needs to be public data so that everyone can see how many people have complained and what areas are affected.\n\n\n1. Feedback on what is actioned from both the council and EA\n\n\n1. Someone to action when the breach is happening. Not days after or give prior notice of site visits\n\n\n1. They should listen to us\n\n\n1. No one dose anything about no matter how many times it's reported so don't know the answer as they should have done things before they were built and never been given the go ahead\n\n\n1. Should investigate and reply to complaints\n\n\n1. physically walk into the oﬃce each time.\n\n\n1. a reply would be a good start\n\n\n1. The MP and councillors need to listed and have regular meetings with residents.\n",

We are targeting completion of the main ground remediation works by September/early October 2018.

These areas of the site are not expected to produce significantly contaminated material or any significant odours.</p>\n<p>The remedial (decontamination) works should be completed by the end of 2018 / early 2019. As stated above the most contaminated areas of the site should have been dealt with by the end of 2017.</p>\n<p>Ealing Council report 2017</p>\n<h1 id=\"should-be-completed-by-the-end-of-2018--early-2019\">Should be completed by the end of 2018 / early 2019&hellip;</h1>\n<p><strong>unusually warm summer; however, we expect this to decrease as the weather</strong> <strong>becomes cooler and the &lsquo;soil hospital&rsquo; activity to be completed in early 2019.

So even when they do finish the soil remediation work, we can expect the odour to continue.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-the-odours-are-within-acceptable-limits\">4. The odours are within acceptable limits</h2>\n<p>If we can smell it, the levels must be between 2.5 parts per million and 5 parts per million (ppm) in the air. Which is way above the workplace legal limit of 1 ppm.</p>\n<p>When we met with Berkeley Group founder and chair, Tony &lsquo;Poison&rsquo; Pidgley, and his Executive Board member lapdog Karl &lsquo;Window Cleaner&rsquo; Whiteman, Karl informed us that benzene levels had averaged 3.25 ppm and never exceeded 5ppm!</p>\n<p>They will state that they are monitored on-site by &lsquo;independent&rsquo; agencies Ealing Environmental Health officers, the Environment Agency, Environ and Atkins, and all find that they are working within their legal permit.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve no doubt that is true, although we&rsquo;ve yet to see the data, despite their promises to give it to us.</p>\n<p>Are the agencies monitoring the site really independent?</p>\n<p>Ealing Council are Berkeley&rsquo;s partners in all of this, and heavily invested in seeing this project through, whatever the cost, in order to achieve their goals for building new &lsquo;affordable&rsquo;homes for Berkeley to sell to investors living in China (also, who will buy the &lsquo;unaffordable&rsquo;homes?).</p>\n<p>How else do you explain the total failure of democracy in Southall and Ealing, where almost all elected representatives have ignored and dismissed residents&rsquo; complaints,just like Berkeley,have for 16 months?</p>\n<p>Environ and Atkins are getting paid to do their &lsquo;independent&rsquo; monitoring.</p>\n<p>While we hope the Environment Agency (EA) is a truly independent monitor,every time we complain to them about the air pollution in our homes, schools, etc., they make an appointment to visit the Southall Waterside site in a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>Amazingly,they then report back that everything is fine on-site and &lsquo;within acceptable limits&rsquo;.They even say that as Berkeley keep investing in more of the totally useless (and presumably cheap) &lsquo;chocolate teapot&rsquo; odour suppressants they use, they have done &lsquo;more than could be reasonably be expected of them&rsquo;!</p>\n<p>Environmental law heavily favours Berkeley, unfortunately, and it appears there is actually very little the EA can do to stop them. Or maybe they just can&rsquo;t be bothered?</p>\n<p>And even if it is all &lsquo;within acceptable limits&rsquo;, that suggests that there are still some toxins in the air and soil.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the cleaned soil they are using to backfill the site with prior to building new homes on it, will first be covered with a &lsquo;geotextile layer&rsquo;, and then concrete, to keep the poison in.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s just lying around in huge uncovered piles, the wind blowing the dust into our homes,gardens, streets, parks, schools, workplaces or places of worship&hellip;.</p>\n<p>And no one is monitoring this at all.</p>\n<p>Strangely, the air quality monitors that were in place in Southall (including at Blair Peach Primary School) were removed in 2016,just before Berkeley Group started work&hellip;</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-the-odour-does-not-pose-a-risk-to-health\">5. The odour does not pose a risk to health</h2>\n<p>Ask them what is causing the smell of petrol?</p>\n<p>The smell of petrol is caused by benzene. (They might say it&rsquo;s due to other hydrocarbons. If they do ask them to specify which ones. They may say there is benzene in your home already - there is, but not so much that you can smell it!)</p>\n<p>Benzene causes cancer. (As do many of the other hydrocarbons.)</p>\n<p>The World Health Organisation says:</p>\n<p>· there are no safe levels of benzene (or many of the other hydrocarbons)</p>\n<p>· indoor air pollution (which is not being monitored by the authorities) is worse than outdoor air pollution (because there is no wind to disperse it)</p>\n<p>· that children are especially vulnerable due to their small size, narrower airways, and being at key physical and cognitive developmental stages.</p>\n<p>There may be other toxins in the air and dust pollution, too, for example asbestos,cyanide and arsenic.</p>\n<p>Many residents have complained of a whole host of symptoms that could be related to exposure to low levels of benzene over sixteen months, including:</p>\n<p>· Headaches</p>\n<p>· Eye, nose and throat irritation</p>\n<p>· Cough</p>\n<p>· Hoarse voice</p>\n<p>· Nausea, stomach pain and vomiting</p>\n<p>· Reduced appetite, fatigue or tiredness</p>\n<p>· Sensitisation</p>\n<p>· Skin rashes</p>\n<p>· Dizziness</p>\n<p>· Breathing difficulties and asthma</p>\n<p>· Fits or seizures</p>\n<p>· Miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy</p>\n<p>· Irritability, stress, depression and anxiety</p>\n<p>The headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School reported an extremely strong smell coming from the gas works site last year, which caused headaches and asthma.</p>\n<p>This was at the same meeting where she and the governors co-opted Richard Watler, Head of Construction at Southall Waterside, on to the board&hellip;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-theres-benzene-in-your-home-already\">6. There&rsquo;s benzene in your home already!</h2>\n<p>Yes, there is. It&rsquo;s in furnishings, carpets, household cleaners, when you grill or burn food you produce benzene, it&rsquo;s in cigarette smoke.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not in our homes to such a level that we can normally smell it like we can smell the petrol odour wafting in from Southall Waterside.</p>\n<p>And, ordinarily, we&rsquo;d be able to ventilate our homes, by OPENING OUR WINDOWS!

				"content_text": "From my [original Facebook note](https://drive.google.com/file/d/184jDHSA56ywO8CawyXnlbZt4gx8gZiz-/view?usp=drivesdk).\n\n## 1.Look how great we are!\n\n\nBerkeley will tell you about all the good work they do in the Southall community:\n\n\n·Giving a tiny fraction of their £600m profits to the local homeless shelter \n\n\n·Creating the 'edible' garden (and ad hoc public toilet) outside the college on Beaconsfield Road\n\n\n·Partnering with the Let's Go Southall project to get Southallians fit, healthy and active!\n\n\n·Making the (acid) Rain Garden at Blair Peach Primary School for children to play in...\n\n\n·Promising that the Southall Waterside development will make your life better by building leisure 'facilities', 'publicly accessible' poisoned parks, and a community 'facility'.\n\n\n·Staff volunteering to be school governors...\n\n\nDon't fall for it.\n\n\n## 2.You are being aggressive or over-emotional!\n\n\nIf you do complain, and especially if you are angry and/or upset about being poisoned by Berkeley Group, they will accuse you of being aggressive and/or letting your emotions get in the way of their 'facts'. They may even threaten to have you escorted out of the room if you are in a face to face encounter with them. Tony Pidgley accused me of continually 'having a pop' at him when we met.\n\n\nWe have every right to be angry and upset.\n\n\nBerkeley Group are the emotionless, aggressive, 'neighbours from hell', who have created - quite literally - a hostile environment for the people of Southall:\n\n\n· They have assaulted us mentally and physically\n\n\n· They have attacked us with poisonous gas and dust\n\n\n· They have harmed our health and damaged our property\n\n\n· We have repeatedly asked them to stop, but they carry on regardless and without any consideration for our health or property\n\n\n· If we did what they do to us, we would be arrested and put in prison\n\n\n· They are like 'serial poopers', but very much worse\n\n\n· At the Air Quality Scrutiny Panel meeting in September, Damian Leydon could not say what amount of upset neighbours or odour nuisance would make him think, 'No, that's too much. I must stop oppressing these people!'\n\n\n## 3. The odorous work will be over soon\n\n\nSorry, but we don't believe you. We've heard it all before...\n\n\nIt should clear in days...\n\n\n**Q. How long is the decontamination work going to last for?**\n\n\n>The programme of remediation (decontamination) is expected to last 2 years, but it is important to take note of two points from above. Firstly, the expected contamination likely to result in odour release is located in areas associated with the cola carbonisation process and secondly these areas are likely to have been dealt with by the end of 2017.\n\n\nLikely to have been dealt with by the end of 2017...\n\n\n## SOUTHALL WATERSIDE\n\n\n## REMEDIATION WORK-FAQ\n\n\n>Thank you for your patience during this time,we understand the inconvenience remediation work on-site is having on local residents.We are pleased to say we are now well over two thirds of the way through. The following update explains why we are doing the remediation work and what we are doing to reduce the impact on our local neighbours.\n\n\n## What is happening at the Southall Waterside site?\n\n\n>You may be aware the site has had an extensive industrial past (including most recently being a gas works), which has left behind some soil and groundwater contamination. Prior to development, a programme of remediation works is being **undertaken** across\n\n\nJuly 2018\n\n\n# Well over two thirds of the way through...\n\n\n(They started in May 2017. 14 months later they claimed to be over 2/3 done. That mean 6-7months left...)\n\n\nThe firm, she added, has reached out to residents and invited them to tour the site and that everything possible is being done to mitigate the smell.\n\n\nShe said that the work will be finished by September and will provide 480 homes - which are much needed in the current housing crisis - 40 acres of public open space and community facilities.\n\n\n## ...the work will be finished by September\n\n\nWe have to date completed in excess of 70% of the ground remediation works on site. We are targeting completion of the main ground remediation works by September/early October 2018. There are three very small areas that will be left due to ongoing National Grid works and the removal of the Information centre (see fig 1 below) these are expected to be low impact and we plan to remove any impacted material to an external registered waste centre.\n\n\nVia email in July 2018\n\n\nCompletion of the main ground remediation works by September/ early October 2018...\n\n\nTo reduce the potential impact of odour, we have cut back the operational output from the soil hospital and, as planned, we will be scaling this area back from mid-November. The barrier foam odour suppressant will continue to be deployed to all impacted material, in addition we have increased our specialist contractor attendances to allow the barrier foam application to be increased throughout the night.\n\n\n14 September 2018 via email\n\n\n# 'Scaling back' from mid-November 2018...\n\n\nThe remainder of the north of the site and east of the site will be excavated in 2018. It is noted that there is not expected to be any contamination in the east of the site, using as playing fields or in the north of the site which was only used for coal storage. These areas of the site are not expected to produce significantly contaminated material or any significant odours.\n\n\nThe remedial (decontamination) works should be completed by the end of 2018 / early 2019. As stated above the most contaminated areas of the site should have been dealt with by the end of 2017.\n\n\nEaling Council report 2017\n\n\n# Should be completed by the end of 2018 / early 2019...\n\n\n**unusually warm summer; however, we expect this to decrease as the weather** **becomes cooler and the 'soil hospital' activity to be completed in early 2019. We fully**\n\n\nEaling Council statement October 2018\n\n\n## To be completed in ealy 2019...\n\n\n<!-- Key Site boundary Remediation areas/boundaries Earthworks and Remediation works complete late 2018 Area occupied by others (no Remediation works undertaken) Earthworks and Remediation works yet to be completed(e.g.inaccessible due to occupation by third parties) National Grid Retained Land National Grid currently dismantling Blue gas holder.Remediation works National Grid currently due to take place late 2019. undertaking works in the Information Centre. area.Remediation works Remediation works due due to take place late 2019. to take place late 2019, -->\n![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/c96f0b78f7467c7d.jpg)\n\n\n# Due to take place late 2019...\n\n\nNot only do we not believe them, but we know from experience that even when the soil hospital is not in operation (from 6pm until 8am, and at weekends, and supposedly sealed with a foam barrier), we still get odour. So even when they do finish the soil remediation work, we can expect the odour to continue.\n\n\n## 4. The odours are within acceptable limits\n\n\nIf we can smell it, the levels must be between 2.5 parts per million and 5 parts per million (ppm) in the air. Which is way above the workplace legal limit of 1 ppm.\n\n\nWhen we met with Berkeley Group founder and chair, Tony 'Poison' Pidgley, and his Executive Board member lapdog Karl 'Window Cleaner' Whiteman, Karl informed us that benzene levels had averaged 3.25 ppm and never exceeded 5ppm!\n\n\nThey will state that they are monitored on-site by 'independent' agencies Ealing Environmental Health officers, the Environment Agency, Environ and Atkins, and all find that they are working within their legal permit.\n\n\nI've no doubt that is true, although we've yet to see the data, despite their promises to give it to us.\n\n\nAre the agencies monitoring the site really independent?\n\n\nEaling Council are Berkeley's partners in all of this, and heavily invested in seeing this project through, whatever the cost, in order to achieve their goals for building new 'affordable'homes for Berkeley to sell to investors living in China (also, who will buy the 'unaffordable'homes?).\n\n\nHow else do you explain the total failure of democracy in Southall and Ealing, where almost all elected representatives have ignored and dismissed residents' complaints,just like Berkeley,have for 16 months?\n\n\nEnviron and Atkins are getting paid to do their 'independent' monitoring.\n\n\nWhile we hope the Environment Agency (EA) is a truly independent monitor,every time we complain to them about the air pollution in our homes, schools, etc., they make an appointment to visit the Southall Waterside site in a couple of weeks.\n\n\nAmazingly,they then report back that everything is fine on-site and 'within acceptable limits'.They even say that as Berkeley keep investing in more of the totally useless (and presumably cheap) 'chocolate teapot' odour suppressants they use, they have done 'more than could be reasonably be expected of them'!\n\n\nEnvironmental law heavily favours Berkeley, unfortunately, and it appears there is actually very little the EA can do to stop them. Or maybe they just can't be bothered?\n\n\nAnd even if it is all 'within acceptable limits', that suggests that there are still some toxins in the air and soil.\n\n\nIndeed, the cleaned soil they are using to backfill the site with prior to building new homes on it, will first be covered with a 'geotextile layer', and then concrete, to keep the poison in.\n\n\nMeanwhile, it's just lying around in huge uncovered piles, the wind blowing the dust into our homes,gardens, streets, parks, schools, workplaces or places of worship....\n\n\nAnd no one is monitoring this at all.\n\n\nStrangely, the air quality monitors that were in place in Southall (including at Blair Peach Primary School) were removed in 2016,just before Berkeley Group started work...\n\n\n## 5. The odour does not pose a risk to health\n\n\nAsk them what is causing the smell of petrol?\n\n\nThe smell of petrol is caused by benzene. (They might say it's due to other hydrocarbons. If they do ask them to specify which ones. They may say there is benzene in your home already - there is, but not so much that you can smell it!)\n\n\nBenzene causes cancer. (As do many of the other hydrocarbons.)\n\n\nThe World Health Organisation says:\n\n\n· there are no safe levels of benzene (or many of the other hydrocarbons)\n\n\n· indoor air pollution (which is not being monitored by the authorities) is worse than outdoor air pollution (because there is no wind to disperse it)\n\n\n· that children are especially vulnerable due to their small size, narrower airways, and being at key physical and cognitive developmental stages.\n\n\nThere may be other toxins in the air and dust pollution, too, for example asbestos,cyanide and arsenic.\n\n\nMany residents have complained of a whole host of symptoms that could be related to exposure to low levels of benzene over sixteen months, including:\n\n\n· Headaches\n\n\n· Eye, nose and throat irritation\n\n\n· Cough\n\n\n· Hoarse voice\n\n\n· Nausea, stomach pain and vomiting\n\n\n· Reduced appetite, fatigue or tiredness\n\n\n· Sensitisation\n\n\n· Skin rashes\n\n\n· Dizziness\n\n\n· Breathing difficulties and asthma\n\n\n· Fits or seizures\n\n\n· Miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy\n\n\n· Irritability, stress, depression and anxiety\n\n\nThe headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School reported an extremely strong smell coming from the gas works site last year, which caused headaches and asthma.\n\n\nThis was at the same meeting where she and the governors co-opted Richard Watler, Head of Construction at Southall Waterside, on to the board....\n\n\n## 6. There's benzene in your home already!\n\n\nYes, there is. It's in furnishings, carpets, household cleaners, when you grill or burn food you produce benzene, it's in cigarette smoke.\n\n\nBut it's not in our homes to such a level that we can normally smell it like we can smell the petrol odour wafting in from Southall Waterside.\n\n\nAnd, ordinarily, we'd be able to ventilate our homes, by OPENING OUR WINDOWS! Something we are unable to do while being attacked by poison gas.\n\n\n## I smell a rat!\n\n\nAlso reported by Mrs Puri, two dead rats were found in the nursery playground at Blair Peach. (Berkeley Group arranged for Rentokil to remove them, apparently!)\n\n\nWhat killed the rats?\n\n\nWhy were Berkeley Group so keen to dispose of the bodies?\n\n\nThere is long and terrible history of governments and corporations lying to the public about the safety of their products and health and safety recommendations. Here are some well known examples:\n\n\n· Tobacco\n\n\n· Asbestos\n\n\n· Dalkon Shield\n\n\n· Thalidomide\n\n\n· Corby Steel Works\n\n\n· Enfield Island Village (MoD site)\n\n\n· Grand Union Village (Taylor Woodrow site)\n\n\n· Bhopal\n\n\n· Grenfell\n\n\nI won't link to these, but encourage people to find out for themselves, and make up their own minds on whether or not to trust Berkeley Group when they tell us it's safe.\n",

Even the kids at @FeatherstonePr2 could work out that 2/3s done means 7 to go?) <span class=\"entity-image\"><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjBnE3ZXsAAI2bk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjBnE3ZXsAAI2bk.jpg\"></a></span></p>\n    <p>Even their own recently produced glossy Remediation Work FAQ contradicts itself.<br>\n<br>\nHe can't even agree with himself!<br>\n<br>\nBack to school, @damian_leydon! <span class=\"row justify-content-center entity-multiple-undefined\"><span class=\"col-md-6\"><span class=\"entity-image\"><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjBngo1XgAAk8uF.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjBngo1XgAAk8uF.jpg\"></a></span></span><br>\n<span class=\"col-md-6\"><span class=\"entity-image\"><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjBnki0XoAAnhkV.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjBnki0XoAAnhkV.jpg\"></a></span></span></span></p>\n    <p>.@damian_leydon has changed his tune, and/or acquired a new calculator!<br>\n<br>\n#SouthallWaterside is now 75% done #MakingSouthallStink and will be finished in time for Christmas! <br>\n<br>\nIt's a miracle!<br>\n<br>\nOnly in #Southall. <span class=\"entity-image\"><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DmCJhV1XgAA42yC.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DmCJhV1XgAA42yC.jpg\"></a></span></p>\n    <p>@damian_leydon @threadreaderapp unroll</p>\n</div>\n",
