				"content_html": "<p>You’ve got to hand it to Peter Mason.</p>\n<p>Every four years he manages to regenerate, reinvent and transform himself and Ealing Labour into a new and improved version of reality.</p>\n<p>He has a creative imagination. His ambition is unbridled. He is resilient and resourceful. Nothing, it seems, can stop him recycling ever more of the same old rubbish manifesto promises while simultaneously presenting them to the public as successful achievements we should want more of.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Of course, it would be unfair to pretend Mason is alone among politicians in this kind of performance. We’ve seen it all before. And that’s really the crux of the problem.</p>\n<p>As the loyal leader of the local incarnation of the “<a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/change/\">Party for (Short) Change</a>,” he is the continuity candidate — the one person most likely to ensure that things stay exactly as they are. Or get even worse.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at the record.</p>\n<p>By his own admission just two weeks ago, Ealing has had <a href=\"https://www.ealinglabour.co.uk/2026/02/03/ealing-labour-announce-first-no-cuts-budget-in-16-years/\">sixteen years of cuts to frontline services under Labour</a> control. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Julian Bell was leader until 2021, but it was <a href=\"https://www.ealinglabour.co.uk/profile/peter-mason-2/\">Mason who coordinated the 2018 manifesto</a>, and it&rsquo;s clear he was heavily involved throughout all sixteen years. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>It is hard to believe the 2022 manifesto, under his fledgling leadership, was written by anyone else. His fingerprints are all over it.</p>\n<p>The priorities themselves have remained broadly the same, even if the labels have been given makeovers.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Mason was cabinet lead for Housing, Planning and Transformation, while colleagues held traditional portfolios for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finance and Leisure</li>\n<li>Business and Community Services</li>\n<li>Health and Adult Services</li>\n<li>Environment and Highways</li>\n<li>Schools and Children’s Services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By 2021, and with an open and transparent promise to uphold the most basic <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2\">Nolan Principles of public life</a>, the same machinery had been repackaged under a new set of slogan-based titles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Genuinely Affordable Homes</li>\n<li>Decent Living Incomes</li>\n<li>A Fairer Start</li>\n<li>Healthy Lives</li>\n<li>Climate Action</li>\n<li>Good Growth</li>\n<li>Inclusive Economy</li>\n<li>Thriving Communities</li>\n<li>Tackling Inequality</li>\n<li>Tackling Crime and Antisocial Behaviour<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There were further cabinet reshuffles, deckchair rearrangements, and revolving door entrances and exits at <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local/\">Perceval House</a> - the seat of local democracy in Ealing - in <a href=\"https://www.aroundealing.com/news/introducing-ealings-new-mayor-and-cabinet/\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aroundealing.com/news/new-mayor-and-cabinet/attachment/new-cabinet/\">2024</a>.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The top table now looks like <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\">this</a>, and there&rsquo;s even some detailed descriptions about who is responsible for what.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a rough guide to who does what in Peter Mason&rsquo;s brave new world of local democracy:</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"cabinet-portfolios-then-and-now\">Cabinet portfolios: then and now</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>2018 functional role</th>\n<th>2021–2026 slogan title</th>\n<th>Core services underneath</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Schools &amp; Children’s Services</td>\n<td><strong>A Fairer Start</strong></td>\n<td>Children’s services, early years, education, SEND</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health &amp; Adult Services</td>\n<td><strong>Healthy Lives</strong></td>\n<td>Adult social care, public health, disability services</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Housing, Planning &amp; Transformation</td>\n<td><strong>Genuinely Affordable Homes</strong> / <strong>Good Growth</strong></td>\n<td>Council housing, planning, regeneration, development</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Finance &amp; Leisure</td>\n<td><strong>Inclusive Economy</strong> / parts of <strong>Thriving Communities</strong></td>\n<td>Finance, procurement, culture, leisure, economic strategy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Business &amp; Community Services</td>\n<td><strong>Thriving Communities</strong></td>\n<td>Libraries, community centres, voluntary sector, neighbourhood services</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Environment &amp; Highways</td>\n<td><strong>Climate Action</strong></td>\n<td>Waste, recycling, transport, highways, air quality, green policies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Employment / regeneration functions</td>\n<td><strong>Decent Living Incomes</strong></td>\n<td>Skills, employment, apprenticeships, local economy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cross-departmental social policy</td>\n<td><strong>Tackling Inequality</strong></td>\n<td>Housing need, welfare support, public health, children’s services, community development</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Community safety and enforcement</td>\n<td><strong>Tackling Crime and Antisocial Behaviour</strong></td>\n<td>ASB teams, enforcement, CCTV, regulatory services, police partnerships</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<p>Instead of departments and delivery, the focus had shifted to something else: a story.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s a very attractive story.</p>\n<p>Who doesn’t want genuinely affordable homes? Who would argue against decent living incomes? Who could oppose a fairer start or healthy lives?</p>\n<p>But if you wanted to know who was actually responsible for delivering those promises — and how much had really been achieved — the answers were often harder to find.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.aroundealing.com/leaders-notes/\">Mason crafted an elaborate tale</a> out of aspirational slogans, and promised ever greater numbers of homes, parks, swimming pools, sports pitches, nature reserves, school streets, living wages - and even <a href=\"https://www.aroundealing.com/leaders-notes/access-to-nature/\">beavers</a> - a different question lingered in the background:</p>\n<p>How does the beautiful story match up to the rather grimmer reality?</p>\n<p>The easiest place to look for an answer is the manifestos themselves. Unlike the cabinet titles, the manifestos came with numbers attached. Clear targets and deadlines. Promises that were supposed to be measurable.</p>\n<p>And both the 2018 and 2022 manifestos were written under the same leadership, by the same man. Same party. Same council. Same housing crisis.</p>\n<p>So they can be compared directly. Not as political ideology, or as spin, but as numbers. And once you put those numbers side by side, the story starts to look very different.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"from-2500-to-4000-to-180\">From 2,500 to 4,000 to 180</h1>\n<h2 id=\"what-changed-between-ealing-labours-2018httpswwwealinglabourcommanifesto2018-and-2022httpswwwealinglabourcommanifesto2022-manifestos\">What changed between Ealing Labour’s <a href=\"https://www.ealinglabour.com/manifesto2018/\">2018</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ealinglabour.com/manifesto2022/\">2022</a> manifestos?</h2>\n<p>In both the 2018 and 2022 local elections, Ealing Labour asked voters for a fresh mandate based on a new manifesto. Both documents were ostensibly written by Peter Mason, and both were built around big, measurable promises — especially on housing.</p>\n<p>But when the two manifestos are placed side by side, a pattern emerges.</p>\n<p>The targets got bigger. The delivery got blurrier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-central-promise-affordable-homes\">The central promise: affordable homes</h2>\n<p>In 2018, the commitment was simple:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2,500 genuinely affordable homes by 2022</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A number. A type of home. A deadline.</p>\n<p>It was one of the centrepieces of the manifesto — presented as one of the most ambitious council housebuilding programmes in London.</p>\n<p>Four years later, the new manifesto raised the stakes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4,000 genuinely affordable homes across the borough</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A bigger number. A new deadline. A fresh promise. But what happened to the original one?</p>\n<h2 id=\"2022-the-councils-own-figures\">2022: the council’s own figures</h2>\n<p>By early 2022, as the 2,500-home deadline approached, the council’s internal performance dashboard showed the housing target marked:</p>\n<p>RED</p>\n<p>The number displayed:</p>\n<p>1,277 homes completed or on site<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/how_many_homes_have_been_complet/response/2002978/attach/5/FOI%20Internal%20Review%2022%200065%20FINAL.pdf\">Freedom of Information response</a> to Ealing Independents gave a clearer breakdown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1,217 homes completed and occupied</li>\n<li>The rest still under construction</li>\n<li>Some not due until 2024 or 2025</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>So by the actual 2022 deadline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fewer than half the promised homes had been completed</li>\n<li>Hundreds existed only as construction sites</li>\n<li>Others were still years away</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-moving-numbers\">The moving numbers</h2>\n<p>Over the life of the programme, the <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2026/01/18/demolition-man-peter-masons-legacy/\">public totals shifted repeatedly</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>898 homes</li>\n<li>1,355 homes</li>\n<li>723 homes</li>\n<li>1,965 homes</li>\n<li>2,442 homes</li>\n<li>2,700 homes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Different announcements. Different definitions. Different counting methods. Sometimes the figures included homes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not completed</li>\n<li>Not occupied</li>\n<li>Or not yet built at all</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, a “new home” meant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A hole in the ground with foundations poured.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"the-2700-claim\">The 2,700 claim</h1>\n<p>During the 2022 election campaign, Labour publicly claimed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Over the last four years, we’ve built 2,700 genuinely affordable homes.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But at the same time:</p>\n<p>The council’s own dashboard showed around 1,217 completed.</p>\n<p>The target was marked RED.</p>\n<p>The higher 2,700 figure appears to have included homes still under construction, in the wider development planning pipeline, and possibly other programmes beyond the core council build.</p>\n<p>In other words, it was a number that was pure &ldquo;political theatre&rdquo;, and absolutely not a number that bore any relation to any lived in reality.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"the-100-million-question\">The £100 million question</h1>\n<p>In 2018, the council received a major grant from the Greater London Authority:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Around £100 million in funding</li>\n<li>A target of 1,138 new affordable homes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But by early 2026 just 180 of those homes had been completed - <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/theviewfromw5/p/ealing-delivers-16-percent-of-its-affordable-homes-target\">about 16% of the target</a>.</p>\n<p>According to a Freedom of Information response, £71.9 million had already been spent and work had started on 836 homes. But only a small fraction were actually finished.</p>\n<p>So even within the programmes underpinning the manifesto promises, delivery lagged far behind the headlines.</p>\n<p>Despite the huge number of new developments across the borough, including over twenty tall towers, and housing potentially over 100,000 people, the proportion of genuinely affordable homes is actually tiny. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Reality doesn&rsquo;t match fantasy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"2022-a-bigger-promise\">2022: a bigger promise</h2>\n<p>Instead of a clear public reckoning with the 2,500-home target, the 2022 manifesto announced a new, bigger and better promise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4,000 genuinely affordable homes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But without a single, consolidated figure showing how many of the original 2,500 had actually been delivered, or how many families had moved in, or what the real baseline was.</p>\n<h2 id=\"202425-still-contributing\">2024–25: still “contributing”</h2>\n<p>By 2024, <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/20045/delivery_plan_2024-25.pdf\">the council’s own delivery plan</a> still listed the same commitment, but the document itself showed something that is, perhaps, revealing. It said the council would:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Contribute to delivery of 4,000 new genuinely affordable homes”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not deliver or complete or achieve, but contribute. The 4,000 figure was still a target. Still a work in progress.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2025-target-off-track\">2025: target off track</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s18496/Housing%20Development%20and%20Regeneration%20Report%20to%20Scrutiny.pdf\">2025 scrutiny report</a> confirmed what the delivery plan implied.</p>\n<p>The programme was supposed to deliver 4,000 genuinely affordable housing starts by 2026.</p>\n<p>But the report also stated the target was off track. It was now expected to reach around 3,000 starts, or 75% of the target. A shortfall of 1,000 homes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-housing-reality-behind-the-manifesto-promises\">The housing reality behind the manifesto promises</h2>\n<p>The manifesto comparisons show a simple pattern:</p>\n<p>2018: promise 2,500 homes. Deliver around half.</p>\n<p>2022: promise 4,000 homes. 2025: target off track by 1,000.</p>\n<p>But the manifesto numbers only tell part of the story. Because over the same period, two other housing trends were unfolding.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"the-waiting-list-that-kept-growing\">The waiting list that kept growing</h1>\n<p>Across public statements, the housing waiting list figures moved steadily upward:</p>\n<p>Around 9,000 families.

Nearly thirty years later, the waiting list is still at similar levels, and the same arguments are still being made.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"climate-bigger-numbers-similar-story\">Climate: bigger numbers, similar story</h1>\n<p>The 2018 manifesto spoke in broad ambitions about carbon neutrality, <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2023/01/26/response-to-ealings-air-quality/\">cleaner air</a> (!), more trees, active travel and green spaces.</p>\n<p>By 2022, the targets were far more specific:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>50,000 new trees</li>\n<li>10 new parks</li>\n<li>800,000 m² of rewilded land</li>\n<li>2,000 EV charging points</li>\n<li>50 School Streets</li>\n<li>Retrofit 750 homes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some progress has been claimed, with around 50 School Streets delivered, 1,000+ EV chargers installed and more than 40,000 new trees planted.</p>\n<p>But for several targets - new parks, rewilding, retrofit numbers, tree canopy targets - there appears to be no clear public scorecard.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"jobs-apprenticeships-and-the-missing-scoreboard\">Jobs, apprenticeships, and the missing scoreboard</h1>\n<p>In 2018, economic promises were broad: support local businesses, attract new industries, expand apprenticeships.</p>\n<p>By 2022, the targets were precise:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10,000 new jobs</li>\n<li>2,000 apprenticeships</li>\n<li>12,000 training outcomes</li>\n<li>£12 million per year developer levy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, no public scorecard I could find.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ealing.news/news/local-jobs-decline-in-ealing/\">According to Ealing.News</a>, &ldquo;Employment in Ealing stood at 176,690 in December 2022 before increasing to 182,992 by December 2023, a gain of more than 6,300.

Or are they just getting bigger each election?</p>\n<p>And if targets are not being met, and election promises are repeatedly broken, why is that?

				"content_text": "You’ve got to hand it to Peter Mason.\n\n\nEvery four years he manages to regenerate, reinvent and transform himself and Ealing Labour into a new and improved version of reality.\n\n\nHe has a creative imagination. His ambition is unbridled. He is resilient and resourceful. Nothing, it seems, can stop him recycling ever more of the same old rubbish manifesto promises while simultaneously presenting them to the public as successful achievements we should want more of.  <br>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/file-000000001050720ab18df3b9be7d42a8.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"A poster criticises Ealing Labour's record with indicative claims about fewer homes, higher taxes, and fewer children's centers over eight years from 2018 to 2026.\"> <br>\n\n\nOf course, it would be unfair to pretend Mason is alone among politicians in this kind of performance. We’ve seen it all before. And that’s really the crux of the problem.\n\n\nAs the loyal leader of the local incarnation of the “[Party for (Short) Change](https://labour.org.uk/change/),” he is the continuity candidate — the one person most likely to ensure that things stay exactly as they are. Or get even worse.\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the record.\n\n\nBy his own admission just two weeks ago, Ealing has had [sixteen years of cuts to frontline services under Labour](https://www.ealinglabour.co.uk/2026/02/03/ealing-labour-announce-first-no-cuts-budget-in-16-years/) control. <br>  \n\nJulian Bell was leader until 2021, but it was [Mason who coordinated the 2018 manifesto](https://www.ealinglabour.co.uk/profile/peter-mason-2/), and it's clear he was heavily involved throughout all sixteen years. <br> \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/img-20210703-101422.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Facebook post by Peter Mason reflects on ten years of Labour victory, discussing campaign strategies, voter contact targets, and personal anecdotes about driving.\"><br>\n\nIt is hard to believe the 2022 manifesto, under his fledgling leadership, was written by anyone else. His fingerprints are all over it.\n\n\nThe priorities themselves have remained broadly the same, even if the labels have been given makeovers.\n\n\nIn 2018, Mason was cabinet lead for Housing, Planning and Transformation, while colleagues held traditional portfolios for:\n* Finance and Leisure\n* Business and Community Services\n* Health and Adult Services\n* Environment and Highways\n* Schools and Children’s Services\n\n\nBy 2021, and with an open and transparent promise to uphold the most basic [Nolan Principles of public life](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2), the same machinery had been repackaged under a new set of slogan-based titles:\n* Genuinely Affordable Homes\n* Decent Living Incomes\n* A Fairer Start\n* Healthy Lives\n* Climate Action\n* Good Growth\n* Inclusive Economy\n* Thriving Communities\n* Tackling Inequality\n* Tackling Crime and Antisocial Behaviour<br>\n\nThere were further cabinet reshuffles, deckchair rearrangements, and revolving door entrances and exits at [Perceval House](https://southallstories.uk/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local/) - the seat of local democracy in Ealing - in [2022](https://www.aroundealing.com/news/introducing-ealings-new-mayor-and-cabinet/) and [2024](https://www.aroundealing.com/news/new-mayor-and-cabinet/attachment/new-cabinet/).  <br>\n\nThe top table now looks like [this](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet), and there's even some detailed descriptions about who is responsible for what.  <br>\n\n\nHere's a rough guide to who does what in Peter Mason's brave new world of local democracy:\n\n--- \n\n## Cabinet portfolios: then and now\n\n\n| 2018 functional role | 2021–2026 slogan title | Core services underneath |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Schools & Children’s Services | **A Fairer Start** | Children’s services, early years, education, SEND |\n| Health & Adult Services | **Healthy Lives** | Adult social care, public health, disability services |\n| Housing, Planning & Transformation | **Genuinely Affordable Homes** / **Good Growth** | Council housing, planning, regeneration, development |\n| Finance & Leisure | **Inclusive Economy** / parts of **Thriving Communities** | Finance, procurement, culture, leisure, economic strategy |\n| Business & Community Services | **Thriving Communities** | Libraries, community centres, voluntary sector, neighbourhood services |\n| Environment & Highways | **Climate Action** | Waste, recycling, transport, highways, air quality, green policies |\n| Employment / regeneration functions | **Decent Living Incomes** | Skills, employment, apprenticeships, local economy |\n| Cross-departmental social policy | **Tackling Inequality** | Housing need, welfare support, public health, children’s services, community development |\n| Community safety and enforcement | **Tackling Crime and Antisocial Behaviour** | ASB teams, enforcement, CCTV, regulatory services, police partnerships |\n\n--- \n\nInstead of departments and delivery, the focus had shifted to something else: a story.\n\n\nAnd it's a very attractive story.\n\nWho doesn’t want genuinely affordable homes? Who would argue against decent living incomes? Who could oppose a fairer start or healthy lives?\n\n\nBut if you wanted to know who was actually responsible for delivering those promises — and how much had really been achieved — the answers were often harder to find.\n\n\nWhile [Mason crafted an elaborate tale](https://www.aroundealing.com/leaders-notes/) out of aspirational slogans, and promised ever greater numbers of homes, parks, swimming pools, sports pitches, nature reserves, school streets, living wages - and even [beavers](https://www.aroundealing.com/leaders-notes/access-to-nature/) - a different question lingered in the background:\n\n\nHow does the beautiful story match up to the rather grimmer reality?\n\n\nThe easiest place to look for an answer is the manifestos themselves. Unlike the cabinet titles, the manifestos came with numbers attached. Clear targets and deadlines. Promises that were supposed to be measurable.\n\n\nAnd both the 2018 and 2022 manifestos were written under the same leadership, by the same man. Same party. Same council. Same housing crisis.\n\n\nSo they can be compared directly. Not as political ideology, or as spin, but as numbers. And once you put those numbers side by side, the story starts to look very different.\n\n\n--- \n\n\n# From 2,500 to 4,000 to 180\n\n## What changed between Ealing Labour’s [2018](https://www.ealinglabour.com/manifesto2018/) and [2022](https://www.ealinglabour.com/manifesto2022/) manifestos?\n\n\nIn both the 2018 and 2022 local elections, Ealing Labour asked voters for a fresh mandate based on a new manifesto. Both documents were ostensibly written by Peter Mason, and both were built around big, measurable promises — especially on housing.\n\n\nBut when the two manifestos are placed side by side, a pattern emerges.\n\n\nThe targets got bigger. The delivery got blurrier.\n\n\n## The central promise: affordable homes\n\n\nIn 2018, the commitment was simple:\n\n\n> 2,500 genuinely affordable homes by 2022\n\n\nA number. A type of home. A deadline.\n\n\nIt was one of the centrepieces of the manifesto — presented as one of the most ambitious council housebuilding programmes in London.\n\n\nFour years later, the new manifesto raised the stakes:\n\n\n> 4,000 genuinely affordable homes across the borough\n\n\nA bigger number. A new deadline. A fresh promise. But what happened to the original one?\n\n\n## 2022: the council’s own figures\n\n\nBy early 2022, as the 2,500-home deadline approached, the council’s internal performance dashboard showed the housing target marked:\n\n\nRED\n\n\nThe number displayed:\n\n\n1,277 homes completed or on site<br>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/fjja-x-xwaqbng6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"993\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: An infographic displays the number of genuinely affordable homes completed and onsite, with 1,277 homes achieved against a target of 1,742 by September 2021.\"><br>\n\n\nA [Freedom of Information response](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/how_many_homes_have_been_complet/response/2002978/attach/5/FOI%20Internal%20Review%2022%200065%20FINAL.pdf) to Ealing Independents gave a clearer breakdown:\n\n\n* 1,217 homes completed and occupied\n* The rest still under construction\n* Some not due until 2024 or 2025\n\n<br><img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20221218-131242.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"1300\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Twitter thread discusses housing promises made by Peter Mason, citing figures from FOI requests regarding the number of homes built by specific years.\"> <br>\n\nSo by the actual 2022 deadline:\n\n\n* Fewer than half the promised homes had been completed\n* Hundreds existed only as construction sites\n* Others were still years away\n\n## The moving numbers\n\n\nOver the life of the programme, the [public totals shifted repeatedly](https://southallstories.uk/2026/01/18/demolition-man-peter-masons-legacy/):\n\n\n* 898 homes\n* 1,355 homes\n* 723 homes\n* 1,965 homes\n* 2,442 homes\n* 2,700 homes\n\nDifferent announcements. Different definitions. Different counting methods. Sometimes the figures included homes:\n\n\n* Not completed\n* Not occupied\n* Or not yet built at all\n\nIn some cases, a “new home” meant:\n\n\n> A hole in the ground with foundations poured.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260116-220103.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"472\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Twitter conversation discusses housing numbers, with one user humorously questioning the affordability of theoretical holes in the ground.\"><br>\n\n\n---\n\n# The 2,700 claim\n\n\nDuring the 2022 election campaign, Labour publicly claimed:\n\n\n> “Over the last four years, we’ve built 2,700 genuinely affordable homes.”\n\n\n\nBut at the same time:\n\n\nThe council’s own dashboard showed around 1,217 completed.\n\n\nThe target was marked RED.\n\n\nThe higher 2,700 figure appears to have included homes still under construction, in the wider development planning pipeline, and possibly other programmes beyond the core council build. \n\nIn other words, it was a number that was pure \"political theatre\", and absolutely not a number that bore any relation to any lived in reality.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The £100 million question\n\n\nIn 2018, the council received a major grant from the Greater London Authority:\n* Around £100 million in funding\n* A target of 1,138 new affordable homes\n\n\nBut by early 2026 just 180 of those homes had been completed - [about 16% of the target](https://open.substack.com/pub/theviewfromw5/p/ealing-delivers-16-percent-of-its-affordable-homes-target).\n\n\nAccording to a Freedom of Information response, £71.9 million had already been spent and work had started on 836 homes. But only a small fraction were actually finished.\n\n\nSo even within the programmes underpinning the manifesto promises, delivery lagged far behind the headlines. \n\nDespite the huge number of new developments across the borough, including over twenty tall towers, and housing potentially over 100,000 people, the proportion of genuinely affordable homes is actually tiny. <br>\n\n\nReality doesn't match fantasy.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## 2022: a bigger promise\n\n\nInstead of a clear public reckoning with the 2,500-home target, the 2022 manifesto announced a new, bigger and better promise:\n\n\n> 4,000 genuinely affordable homes\n\n\nBut without a single, consolidated figure showing how many of the original 2,500 had actually been delivered, or how many families had moved in, or what the real baseline was.\n\n\n## 2024–25: still “contributing”\n\n\nBy 2024, [the council’s own delivery plan](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/20045/delivery_plan_2024-25.pdf) still listed the same commitment, but the document itself showed something that is, perhaps, revealing. It said the council would:\n\n\n> “Contribute to delivery of 4,000 new genuinely affordable homes”\n\n\nNot deliver or complete or achieve, but contribute. The 4,000 figure was still a target. Still a work in progress.\n\n\n## 2025: target off track\n\n\nA [2025 scrutiny report](https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s18496/Housing%20Development%20and%20Regeneration%20Report%20to%20Scrutiny.pdf) confirmed what the delivery plan implied. \n\n\nThe programme was supposed to deliver 4,000 genuinely affordable housing starts by 2026. \n\n\nBut the report also stated the target was off track. It was now expected to reach around 3,000 starts, or 75% of the target. A shortfall of 1,000 homes.\n\n\n## The housing reality behind the manifesto promises\n\n\nThe manifesto comparisons show a simple pattern:\n\n\n2018: promise 2,500 homes. Deliver around half.\n\n\n2022: promise 4,000 homes. 2025: target off track by 1,000.\n\n\nBut the manifesto numbers only tell part of the story. Because over the same period, two other housing trends were unfolding.\n\n---\n\n\n# The waiting list that kept growing\n\n\nAcross public statements, the housing waiting list figures moved steadily upward:\n\n\nAround 9,000 families. Then 10,000. Then 11,000. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260218-204959-collage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Peter Mason's tweets from May 2020, October 2022 and February 2023 show the numbers of families waiting for suitable housing in Ealing rising from 9,000 to 10,000 to 11,000.\"><br>\n\nThen the official number suddenly dropped.\n\n\nToday, the council says there are: around 7,500 \"live applications\".\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, it looks like progress. But the reason was not a wave of new homes.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n## The register was tightened\n\n\nIn September 2023, the council introduced a new allocations policy. Under the new system all Band D applicants were removed from the register. Band D was the lowest-priority group. It included thousands of households in housing need. Those families were not rehoused. They were simply no longer counted.\n\n\nVia a private communication from a reliable source, I was informed that councillors were told:\n\n> Currently there are over 12,000 applications on the Housing Register, and this grows by over 100 additional applications per month.\n\nSo the waiting list dropped:\n\n\nFrom around 12,000 families to about 7,500 applications with the stroke of a pen. Not because homes were built or delivered, but because the list was redefined.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n## The demolition factor\n\n\nAt the same time, another trend was taking place. According to [analysis by the London Tenants Federation](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/londons-social-housing-depleted-by-demolition-study-claims):\n* 12,050 social-rent homes were built in London over ten years\n* 22,895 were demolished\n\n\n\n\nNearly twice as many homes were lost as gained.\n\n\nAnd the borough with the highest number of demolitions?\n\n\nEaling.\n\n\nThe study found almost 5,000 social homes demolished in the borough. Many were cleared as part of regeneration schemes, where older social-rent homes were demolished, replacement homes were built later, and often at higher “affordable rent” levels rather than at \"social rent\" levels.\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260215-085240.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"321\" alt=\"A story in the Architects' Journal reports on a study claiming that almost 5,000 social housing units in Ealing have been demolished in the last decade, exacerbating homelessness and overcrowding.\"><br>\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The long view: 9,000 families, then and now\n\n\nThe waiting list has been high for decades. A local newspaper report from 1996 recorded 9,000 families on the waiting list.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260215-094902.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"551\" alt=\"A newspaper article from 1996 discusses 9,000 people waiting for council housing. Ealing Labour politician Virendra Sharma announces ambitious plans to make 1,500 new homes available every year, while blaming central government controls on local authority spending powers.\"><br>\n\n\nNearly thirty years later, the number had risen above 12,000. The later drop to 7,500 came only after thousands were removed from the register.\n\n\nSo by the early 2020s, the waiting list was higher than it had been in the mid-1990s.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n## The same argument, thirty years apart\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260215-094855.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"442\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Twitter post by Peter Mason discusses efforts to address homelessness and rising temporary accommodation needs, mentioning 31 homes in Acton.\"><br>\n\n\nWhen challenged about the waiting list, council leaders point to funding cuts.\n\n\nIn 2021, London Councils said boroughs had seen a 25% real-terms fall in core spending power since 2010. At the same time, Ealing claimed its direct government grant had been cut by 64%. Both figures can be technically correct. They measure different things. But the deeper pattern is harder to ignore.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260216-105231.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A bar chart illustrates the percentage changes in public spending from 2010/11 to 2021/22, showing a decrease in local government core spending power, especially in London.\"><br>\n\nBack in 1996, councillors were already saying:\n\n\n> “The Government has the money. All that is lacking is the political will to spend it.”\n\n\nThey blamed Whitehall (central government) spending restrictions. Nearly thirty years later, the waiting list is still at similar levels, and the same arguments are still being made. \n\n\n---\n\n\n# Climate: bigger numbers, similar story\n\n\nThe 2018 manifesto spoke in broad ambitions about carbon neutrality, [cleaner air](https://southallstories.uk/2023/01/26/response-to-ealings-air-quality/) (!), more trees, active travel and green spaces.\n\n\n\n\nBy 2022, the targets were far more specific:\n* 50,000 new trees\n* 10 new parks\n* 800,000 m² of rewilded land\n* 2,000 EV charging points\n* 50 School Streets\n* Retrofit 750 homes\n\n\n\n\nSome progress has been claimed, with around 50 School Streets delivered, 1,000+ EV chargers installed and more than 40,000 new trees planted.\n\n\n\n\nBut for several targets - new parks, rewilding, retrofit numbers, tree canopy targets - there appears to be no clear public scorecard.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Jobs, apprenticeships, and the missing scoreboard\n\n\nIn 2018, economic promises were broad: support local businesses, attract new industries, expand apprenticeships.\n\n\n\n\nBy 2022, the targets were precise:\n* 10,000 new jobs\n* 2,000 apprenticeships\n* 12,000 training outcomes\n* £12 million per year developer levy\n\n\nAgain, no public scorecard I could find.\n\n[According to Ealing.News](https://www.ealing.news/news/local-jobs-decline-in-ealing/), \"Employment in Ealing stood at 176,690 in December 2022 before increasing to 182,992 by December 2023, a gain of more than 6,300. Figures for December 2025 show there were 181,325 people employed in the borough, down 2,195 compared with the same month a year earlier.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The developer levy: a late arrival\n\n\nThe 2022 manifesto promised a new \"developer tax\" raising £12 million per year. \n\n\nBut the Community Infrastructure Levy was only approved two months ago in December 2025, to [begin in March 2026](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201162/planning_policy/1536/community_infrastructure_levy_cil).\n\n\n\n\n[Opposition councillors](https://www.ealinglibdems.org.uk/news/article/ealing-labour-finally-tax-developers-after-15-years-delay) say this followed a 15-year delay and estimate up to £90 million in lost infrastructure funding. \n\nThe exact figure is disputed, but the timing is not. \n\nIt's certainly true that by far the largest new development - the [massive expansion of the Southall Gasworks site from 3,750 new homes to 8,100](https://archive.ph/kfpaA) - was approved by the planning committee in November 2025, despite around a hundred local objections. \n\nAnother three or four months, and that would have been necessitated Berkeley Group making a very large CIL payment to the borough. \n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Council tax: the quiet background story\n\n\nAcross both manifestos, Labour presented itself as shielding residents from austerity. But since 2018, council tax has risen repeatedly. Several increases were close to or at the legal maximum. The 2023/24 rise was nearly 5%. The council attributes this to social care pressures and reduced government funding.\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260218-214204.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"362\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A line graph shows the projected increase in average council tax in Ealing from 2021/22 to 2025/26, reaching £2,041.02 in 2025/26.\"><br>\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The big picture\n\n\nUnder Ealing Labour and under Mason's watch:\n\n\n* The housing waiting list rose from 9,000 to 12,000\n* 5,000 social homes were demolished\n* They have been replaced by far fewer than 5,000 \"genuinely affordable homes\" (the social rent proportion likely to be much less than 50% of that figure) completed and ready to live in\n* Housing targets have been repeatedly missed, and [half-built homes will have to be demolished](https://southallstories.uk/2026/01/18/demolition-man-peter-masons-legacy/) \n* [Developer tax has been wasted](https://southallstories.uk/2026/02/14/section-money-where-did-southalls/) and essential large infrastructure projects were simply abandoned \n* All of this while Mason was cabinet lead for housing, planning and transformation while qualifying as a town planner at the prestigious Bartlett School of Planning before he became leader. \n\nHe had the expertise. He had the power. He had the resources.\n\n> **What he lacked was the political will to prioritise residents over developers.**\n\n\n* Council tax has gone up 22% over five years\n* [Fly-tipping has more than doubled](https://southallstories.uk/2026/02/13/bangarang-pirate-pete-and-the/)\n* It costs more to clean up the rubbish than was saved by switching to fortnightly waste collections in 2016\n* Children's centres cut\n* **70% pay rise for Mason**\n\nBut the gap between slogan and reality was perhaps clearest in environmental policy. \n\nThe 2018 manifesto promised to \"use our powers, as we have in Acton and Southall, to go after polluting industries that show no regard for the quality of our air.\"\n\n\nOne year later, Mason was accepting Berkeley Group hospitality at the MIPIM property developers festival in the south of France, all while Berkeley poisoned Southall residents with benzene and naphthalene at levels way above legal limits. \n\n\nWhen residents complained, his response was: enforcement \"wouldn't stack up in court.\"\n\n\n> **Mason didn't go after the polluting industry. He went partying with them in Cannes.**\n\n\nNot on your side.\n\n---\n\n\n# The transparency gap\n\n\nThe biggest difference between the two manifestos is not the promises. It is the absence of a clear, public scorecard showing:\n* Which promises were met\n* Which were missed\n* Which were quietly rolled forward into the next election\n\n\n\n\nInstead, to find answers to make informed choices, residents must dig through Cabinet reports, budget papers, scrutiny documents, and press releases just to piece together partial answers.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The obvious question\n\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, the housing target rose from 2,500 to 4,000 homes. Between 2022 and 2026, many of the new promises still lack clear public outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nSo the question for voters is simple: are targets being delivered? Are manifesto promises being kept? Or are they just getting bigger each election?\n\n\nAnd if targets are not being met, and election promises are repeatedly broken, why is that? Because it's not actually all Peter Mason's fault. The same happened ten years ago under Julian Bell. The same happened thirty years ago when Virendra Sharma was a councillor before he became an MP. \n\n\nPeter Mason [knows why](https://www.ealinglabour.co.uk/2020/03/02/tall-buildings-and-the-genuinely-affordable-homes-crisis/):\n\n> [E]ver since the 1980’s, and Thatcher’s dismantling of the social housing sector, local authorities have been starved of the funding they need to build the next generation of council housing.\n\nUnder Blair and Brown's New Labour, under the Tory/LibDem austerity coalition that forced ordinary people to pay for crimes committed by Wall Street bankers, and under Keir Starmer's Labour Party, the political will has consistently favoured mega rich housebuilders over the needs of people to live in decent housing.\n\nChange will be hard. And it won't happen overnight. But the mainstream parties are all gatekeepers for the status quo, developers and the ruling classes. \n\nWe need [people in local and national government who will actually stand up for the needs of ordinary people](https://southallstories.uk/2022/12/17/the-property-lobby-the-hidden/). \n\n",

“developer tax” by Ealing Council - is paid by developers as a form of mitigation for being allowed to build schemes that would otherwise place extra strain on local infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The national <a href=\"https://www.planningportal.co.uk/planning/planning-applications/the-decision-making-process/conditions-and-obligations\">Planning Portal</a> defines S106 thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Planning obligations, also known as Section 106 agreements (based on that section of The 1990 Town &amp; Country Planning Act) are private agreements made between local authorities and developers and can be attached to a planning permission to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In plain English, that can sound less like mitigation and more like a system where developments become acceptable once the right cheque is written.</p>\n<p>In Southall, they&rsquo;re known euphemistically as &ldquo;brown envelopes&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>In theory, it works like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A developer gets planning permission.</li>\n<li>The council negotiates a Section 106 agreement.</li>\n<li>The developer pays contributions for things like:\n<ul>\n<li>Schools</li>\n<li>GP surgeries</li>\n<li>Parks</li>\n<li>Roads</li>\n<li>Air quality</li>\n<li>Training and

promises in Southall, including infrastructure and housing projects that were either abandoned or failed to deliver as planned.\">\n\n\n---\n\n\nWith council elections less than three months away, Ealing Council is busy using \"[Ealing Council’s magazine for residents](https://www.aroundealing.com/about/)\" to promote news of Ealing Labour's local \"[achievements](https://www.aroundealing.com/category/news/)\" in an effort to persuade voters that, despite national Labour's dismal regurgitation of failed and cruel Tory government austerity policies and shameless political scandals going right to the heart of the UK establishment, Peter Mason's Ealing Labour are still \"on your side\".  \n\n\nYesterday I looked at [fly-tipping data](https://southallstories.uk/2026/02/13/bangarang-pirate-pete-and-the/) after the council announced in its [draft 2026-27 budget](https://www.aroundealing.com/news/budget-for-a-safe-clean-and-fair-borough/) yet another \"crackdown\" to solve an expensive problem that appears to be largely of its own making.  \n\n\n\n\n\nA week later the council trumpeted its \"success\" in securing [£27m from developers](https://www.aroundealing.com/news/developer-tax-investment-in-towns/) to create much-needed infrastructure to cope with the circa 100,000 new residents expected to live in the more than 120 new tower blocks approved for development across the borough.  \n\n\n<img

units, and their respective heights, with additional statistics on housing and population impact.\">  \n\n_Graphic from [Stop The Towers](https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns) campaign_\n\n---  \n\nSection 106 money - described as a “developer tax” by Ealing Council - is paid by developers as a form of mitigation for being allowed to build schemes that would otherwise place extra strain on local infrastructure.  \n\n\nThe national [Planning Portal](https://www.planningportal.co.uk/planning/planning-applications/the-decision-making-process/conditions-and-obligations) defines S106 thus:  \n\n> \"Planning obligations, also known as Section 106 agreements (based on that section of The 1990 Town & Country Planning Act) are private agreements made between local authorities and developers and can be attached to a planning permission to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms.\"  \n\nIn plain English, that can sound less like mitigation and more like a system where developments become acceptable once the right cheque is written.  \n\nIn Southall, they're known euphemistically as \"brown envelopes\".  \n\nIn theory, it works like this:\n\n\n- A developer gets planning permission.\n- The council negotiates a Section 106 agreement.\n- The developer pays contributions for things like:\n  - Schools\n  - GP surgeries\n  - Parks\n  - Roads\n  - Air quality\n  - Training and employment\n\n\nThe idea is simple:  \n\n**if you add thousands of new residents, you help pay for the infrastructure they’ll need.**\n\n\nIn practice, the numbers for Southall tell a more complicated story.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Southall’s Section 106 balance sheet (2019–2024)\n\n\nUsing Ealing Council’s own [Infrastructure Funding Statements](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201162/planning_policy/2934/infrastructure_funding_statement), we can track how much S106 money Southall generated and how much was actually spent there.\n\n\n## Five-year totals\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/file-00000000cf20724380bfa06f5ce47ff9.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Southall generated £13.1m in developer contributions over five years, spending £4.9m locally, resulting in an £8.2m net outflow.\">\n\n--- \n\n**2019–20 to 2023–24:**\n\n\n| Category | Amount |\n|---------|-------:|\n| S106 income from Southall developments | **£13.1 million** |\n| S106 spending in Southall | **£4.9 million** |\n| Net position | **+£8.2 million** |\n\n--- \n\n> Over five years, Southall generated at least £13.1m in developer contributions but received £4.9m in spending—a net outflow of £8.2m.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## The spike year: 2022–23\n\n\n| Year | Southall income | Southall spend |\n|------|----------------:|---------------:|\n| 2022–23 | **£7.15m** | **£0.78m** |\n\n--- \n\nSo in that one year alone:\n\n\n> Southall generated over £7 million in developer contributions, but less than £800,000 was spent locally.\n\n\nThat’s a net outflow of **£6.3 million** in a single year.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Where the money actually went\n\n\nWhen you look at the project lists, most of the Southall spending falls into a few categories.\n\n\n## The biggest single project\n**Southall Market affordable housing**\n- Around **£899,000** in S106 spending\n- The largest single Southall project across the five years\n\n\nThis scheme:\n- Stalled in 2023\n- Is [now at risk of demolition](https://southallstories.uk/2026/01/18/demolition-man-peter-masons-legacy/)\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/pxl-20260117-1412447742.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"451\" alt=\"The Southall Market Car Park construction site features several high-rise buildings covered in scaffolding, with a street sign reading Market Place in the foreground.\">\n\n--- \n\n\nSo a large share of the town’s S106 spending is tied up in a project that may never deliver homes.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## The next largest item\n**Southall foot and cycle bridge**\n- Around **£225,000** in S106 funding\n\n\nAfter that, most projects are much smaller:\n\n\n- Outdoor gyms\n- Running tracks\n- Tree planting\n- Small park upgrades\n- Air-quality monitoring\n- Training schemes\n- Minor highways works\n\n\nMany are in the **£5,000–£100,000 range**.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Big allocations that never materialised\n\n\nSome of the largest Southall allocations were not actually spent.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n- **Southall health hub:** £1.81m allocated (2022–23), unspent at year end\n- Public realm works: £328k allocated, unspent\n\n\nSo even where large sums were earmarked, the infrastructure often **wasn’t delivered**.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Southall vs Acton: the growth areas compared\n\n\nOver four comparable years (2020–21 to 2023–24):\n\n\n| Town | Total income | Total spend | Net position |\n|------|-------------:|------------:|-------------:|\n| **Southall** | £12.4m | £4.9m | **+£7.5m** |\n| **Acton** | £15.6m | £6.1m | **+£9.5m** |\n\n--- \n\nBoth of the borough’s biggest growth areas:\n\n\n- Generated huge S106 income\n- Received far less in spending than they produced\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Southall Gasworks (aka The Green Quarter): a flagship scheme\n\n\nThe [council’s own FOI response](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/how_much_section_106_money_has_e/response/2061857/attach/5/EIR%20Internal%20Review%2022%200404%20FINAL.pdf?cookie_passthrough=1) gives a rare scheme-specific total.\n\n\n## Southall Gasworks (aka Green Quarter) S106 (2015–2022)\n\n\nTotal received from the development:\n\n\n**£1,749,584**\n\n\nFor one of the largest housing developments in West London, delivering thousands of homes, that’s:\n\n\n> Under £2 million in S106 contributions over seven years.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## What that money paid for\n\n\n| Contribution | Amount |\n|-------------|-------:|\n| Education | £840,363 |\n| Swimming pool contribution | £188,558 |\n| Employment & training | £256,955 |\n| Air quality | £129,226 |\n| Highways and bus lane | £146,000 |\n| Signage & CPZ review | £138,482 |\n| [Contaminated land officer](https://southallstories.uk/2019/08/25/southall-under-siege-the-neighbours/) | £50,000 |\n\n\nTotal: **£1.75m**\n\n\nBut:\n\n\n- There is **no new swimming pool** serving the development.\n- The education funding is not tied to a clearly visible new Southall school.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The council’s £27 million claim\n\n\nRecently, the council said:\n\n\n> “£27 million has been invested in our borough since 2022, paid for by developers.”\n\n\nBut the official figures show:\n\n\n- 2022–23 S106 spend: **£3.9m**\n- 2023–24 S106 spend: **£11.5m**\n\n\nTotal spent since 2022:\n- **£15.4 million**\n\n\nSo the £27m figure appears to include allocations or commitments, not just actual spending.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Southall’s share since 2022\n\n\n| Year | Southall income | Southall spend |\n|------|----------------:|---------------:|\n| 2022–23 | £7.15m | £0.78m |\n| 2023–24 | £0.83m | £1.49m |\n\n\nTwo-year totals:\n\n\n- Southall income: **£8.0m**\n- Southall spend: **£2.3m**\n\n\n> Since 2022, Southall has generated almost £8m in developer contributions but received only about £2.3m in spending.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The bottom line\n\n\nAcross five years:\n\n\n- Southall generated at least **£13.1 million** in S106 income.\n- Only **£4.9 million** was spent in the town.\n- Net outflow: **£8.2 million**.\n\n\nAnd much of that spending was:\n\n\n- One stalled housing project\n- One foot and cycle bridge\n- A scattering of smaller schemes\n\n\nMeanwhile, the biggest allocations - like the Southall health hub - remain undelivered.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n# The £11.8 million bridge that was never built\n\n\nOne of the biggest infrastructure promises tied to Southall’s redevelopment was the widening of South Road bridge, the main road over the railway near the station.\n\n\n\n\nThis was not a minor improvement. \n\n\n\n\nIt was a core mitigation project secured through a Section 106 agreement on the former gasworks site — now the Green Quarter.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to [the council’s own report](https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s1730/Appendix%204%20South%20Road%20Bridge%20Widening%20June%202022.pdf):\n\n\n\n\n> “The widening of the South Road Bridge is a S106 planning obligation on the Green Quarter site (formerly Southall Gas Works) and was secured in 2010.”\n\n\n\n\nThe logic was simple:\n\n\n\n\nThousands of new homes were planned around the station.\n\n\n\n\nTraffic levels were expected to rise sharply.\n\n\n\n\nThe bridge widening would help reduce congestion and improve access.\n\n\n\n\nThe council report explained:\n\n\n\n\n> “With the considerable volume of new housing currently being developed in Southall… additional measures and infrastructure is required to reduce traffic congestion… South Road bridge widening has been long proposed as a measure to help reduce the congestion.”\n\n\n\n\n## What went wrong\n\n\n\n\nOriginally, around £11.875 million was available for the project through S106 and housing zone funding.\n\n\nBut costs spiralled.\n\n\n\n\nBy 2021: The estimated construction cost had risen to £29.6 million.\n\n\nBy 2022: The council had already spent £2.58 million on feasibility studies, design and pre-construction work.\n\n\nBut concluded the project was no longer viable.\n\n\nThe report recommended:\n\n\n> “The Council should not commission any further technical or design work on this project… and close the project.”\n\n\n## The outcome\n\n\n| Item | Status |\n|---|---|\n| S106 obligation secured | 2010 |\n| Infrastructure promised | South Road bridge widening |\n| Budget available | £11.875m |\n| Spent on design/pre-construction | £2.58m |\n| Final estimated cost | £29.6m |\n| Outcome | Project abandoned |  \n\n--- \n\n\n\nThe housing went ahead.\n\n\nThe bridge widening never did.\n\n\nThis is a textbook example of how Section 106 is supposed to work in theory - major development is approved because infrastructure will follow - and how it can fail in practice when the promised mitigation is never delivered.\n\n\n---\n\nThe council says the developer tax is working. \n\n\nThe figures suggest something else: millions flowing in, much less flowing back, and a bridge that was meant to arrive before Crossrail that never came at all. \n\n\nWith the elections just weeks away, Southall’s voters may want to look past the slogans and ask a very old-fashioned question: where did the money go?\n",

Coming just three months before local council elections in May, it is full of what many voters will see as nothing more than simple electoral bribes.</p>\n<p>Ealing Labour Leader Peter Mason hailed it as the first council budget in sixteen years that doesn&rsquo;t cut frontline services such as <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/about/what-local-government\">social care, schools, housing and planning and waste collection</a>.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s quite an admission.</p>\n<p>Sixteen years of Ealing Labour cutting frontline services as if they were Tories.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ealing Labour always blamed the national Tory government cuts to local government funding.

I’m trying my very best.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a not uncommon sight here to see disabled people forced to risk their lives by walking with their mobility aids in the road because the pavements are impassable due to rubbish bags, mattresses, fridges, broken glass, illegally parked cars, and broken pavements.</p>\n<p>Also last year, my brilliant community pharmacist, Rahul Puri, explained the <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfJ3fLA/\">serious public health harms</a> arising directly as a result of the dramatic rise of fly-tipping in Southall, an area already extremely vulnerable to <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/categories/health/\">health problems</a> and stressors.</p>\n<h1 id=\"fly-tipping-doubled-when-weekly-rubbish-collections-ended-in-2016\">Fly-tipping doubled when weekly rubbish collections ended in 2016</h1>\n<p><strong>Official government data shows the number of fly-tipping incidents doubled after 2016 and the introduction of fortnightly wheelie bin collections. Ealing Council&rsquo;s own numbers show it costs millions. And the solution they won&rsquo;t consider would save £1-1.6 million per year.</strong></p>\n<p>What actually happened is recorded in the government&rsquo;s own statistics: fly-tipping in Ealing doubled overnight and has cost council taxpayers millions every year since.</p>\n<p>Three months after weekly collections ended, the council was already announcing a <a href=\"https://www.aroundealing.com/news/finding-and-fining-the-fly-tippers/\">fly-tipping crackdown</a>.</p>\n<p>In November 2016, it reported that new taskforce crews had visited 763 streets and traced dumped waste back to 1,124 addresses in just three months. The message from cabinet member Bassam Mahfouz was simple: “We will find you and we will fine you.”</p>\n<p>The enforcement narrative was in place almost immediately after the service change - just as the official data shows fly-tipping doubling across the borough.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to escape the impression that the council knew the service change would create a problem and prepared to police the consequences rather than reconsider the policy itself.</p>\n<p>Some might argue the rise could simply reflect better reporting rather than more fly-tipping. But the data shows a different pattern. Incidents were stable for years, then almost exactly doubled in the same year weekly collections ended - and have remained at that higher level ever since.</p>\n<p>Reporting changes usually produce short-term spikes or gradual trends. What Ealing’s figures show is a sudden, permanent step-change, which strongly suggests a real increase in dumping rather than just better record-keeping.</p>\n<p>Ealing Council now spends <strong><a href=\"https://www.aroundealing.com/news/fly-tippers-pay-for-their-actions/\">£3 million annually</a></strong> clearing fly-tipping whilst claiming the problem is down to residents' behaviour.</p>\n<p>Now Ealing Southall&rsquo;s MP and formerly Peter Mason&rsquo;s deputy leader of the council, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/E_NoNRlJasw\">Deirdre Costigan</a> visited Southall Green in March 2022 to launch yet another ineffective authoritarian pre-election crackdown on fly-tipping.</p>\n<p>Costigan said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here in Southall today with our fly-tip enforcement and clearing team to talk about our new zero tolerance approach to illegal dumping. Ealing is a brilliant place to live but a small minority of people spoil things for the rest of us by fly tipping in our borough.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She claimed that this small minority of people in Southall &ldquo;don&rsquo;t play by the rules&rdquo; and that their actions are &ldquo;disgusting, irresponsible and illegal.&rdquo; She also states that the council&rsquo;s CCTV surveillance and enforcement mechanisms are inadequate.</p>\n<p>But the government data tells a different story: <strong>Ealing Council created the problem, spent ten years managing the symptoms, and refuses to consider the solution because it would mean admitting the original policy was a catastrophic mistake.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"what-the-official-data-shows\">What the official data shows</h1>\n<p>The table below uses <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-statistics-for-england\">Defra&rsquo;s national fly-tipping dataset</a>, with population-adjusted rates per 1,000 residents to control for population growth.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th>Total Incidents</th>\n<th>Population</th>\n<th>Incidents per 1,000 residents</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2012–13</td>\n<td>6,352</td>\n<td>336,900</td>\n<td>18.9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2013–14</td>\n<td>5,765</td>\n<td>338,000</td>\n<td>17.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2014–15</td>\n<td>7,257</td>\n<td>339,000</td>\n<td>21.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2015–16</td>\n<td>7,032</td>\n<td>339,700</td>\n<td>20.7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2016–17</strong></td>\n<td><strong>14,270</strong></td>\n<td><strong>340,000</strong></td>\n<td><strong>42.0</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2017–18</td>\n<td>13,610</td>\n<td>340,500</td>\n<td>40.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2019–20</td>\n<td>13,115</td>\n<td>341,806</td>\n<td>38.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2020–21</td>\n<td>13,090</td>\n<td>340,341</td>\n<td>38.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2021–22</td>\n<td>12,303</td>\n<td>366,762</td>\n<td>33.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2022–23</td>\n<td>12,922</td>\n<td>369,937</td>\n<td>34.9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2023–24</td>\n<td>16,828</td>\n<td>375,340</td>\n<td>44.8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>The pattern is undeniable:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Four years of stability</strong> (2012–16): Fly-tipping averaged 17–21 incidents per 1,000 residents</li>\n<li><strong>One year of catastrophe</strong> (2016–17): Jumped to 42 incidents per 1,000 residents</li>\n<li><strong>Eight years of plateau</strong> (2017–24): Remained at 33–45 incidents per 1,000 residents</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>That&rsquo;s a 137% increase per person</strong> from 2012–13 to 2023–24.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t explained by population growth.

£328,000</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The council would be making money from fly-tipping.</strong></p>\n<p>Now, they&rsquo;re not actually collecting £1,000 per fine — most are Fixed Penalty Notices at lower amounts, and many go unpaid. But the theoretical possibility exists.</p>\n<p><strong>And that creates a perverse incentive:</strong></p>\n<p>The more fly-tipping occurs, the more enforcement opportunities exist, the more fine income potentially flows in.</p>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s like something out of Catch-22.</strong></p>\n<p>Milo Minderbinder would be proud: create a problem through policy change, establish an enforcement regime, generate revenue from the problem you created, claim you&rsquo;re &ldquo;tackling&rdquo; the issue whilst financially benefiting from its continuation.</p>\n<p><strong>Everyone in the syndicate gets richer — except the residents whose streets are covered in rubbish and who are paying for enforcement through their council tax.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"the-childrens-centres-connection\">The children&rsquo;s centres connection</h1>\n<p>In 2023–24, Ealing Council began consulting on closing 10 of the borough&rsquo;s 25 <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local/\">children&rsquo;s centres</a>, claiming budget pressures.</p>\n<p>The projected savings?

Policy imposed without genuine consultation</strong><br>\nOver 7,000 residents signed a petition against wheelie bins. The council ignored them and implemented the policy anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Environmental rhetoric masking cost-cutting</strong><br>\nPromised &ldquo;cleaner streets&rdquo; whilst implementing cost-saving measures that created the opposite outcome.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Costs externalised onto residents</strong><br>\nFortnightly collections create storage problems in terraced housing, HMOs and all the new tower blocks (Southall&rsquo;s predominant housing types). Residents bear the burden whilst council claims savings.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Claims contradicted by measurable outcomes</strong><br>\nPromised streets would be &ldquo;cleaner.&rdquo; Data shows fly-tipping doubled and remained at that level for ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Blame shifted to residents</strong><br>\nWhen policy causes problem, council blames &ldquo;behaviour&rdquo; and &ldquo;awareness&rdquo; rather than examining whether the policy itself failed.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Expensive symptom management instead of admitting failure</strong><br>\nSpend £1.9 million on enforcement rather than £1.7 million on service improvement, because the latter would require admitting the original policy was wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>7. No outcomes evaluation</strong><br>\nReport activity statistics (investigations, fines, warnings) without ever asking: &ldquo;Did the policy we implemented in 2016 cause the doubling? Should we reverse it?&rdquo;</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"what-this-proves\">What this proves</h1>\n<p><strong>1. The data is undeniable</strong><br>\nFly-tipping per resident almost exactly doubled in the year after fortnightly collections were introduced. No other borough-wide change explains the timing or scale.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The cost is substantial</strong><br>\n£14.5 million in additional clearance costs over eight years, plus £1.9 million annual enforcement spending, far exceeds the claimed £1.7 million annual savings.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The solution is obvious</strong><br>\nReturn to weekly collections. It would be cheaper, more effective, and address the root cause rather than managing symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>4. The political calculation is clear</strong><br>\nThe council prioritises avoiding admission of policy failure over fiscal responsibility and effectiveness.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Residents were right all along</strong><br>\nThe 7,000+ people who opposed wheelie bins, the residents who predicted fly-tipping would increase, the community members who&rsquo;ve complained for ten years — they were all correct.</p>\n<p><strong>6. The council&rsquo;s approach to evidence</strong><br>\nWhen data contradicts promises, ignore the data, blame residents, and spend millions managing the problem you created rather than reversing the policy that caused it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"where-are-we-now\">Where are we now?</h1>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>Now, if anyone has any bright ideas about how to make Southall cleaner and more pleasant, the mega rich developers building more than ten thousand new homes in tens of new tower blocks have kindly given us <strong>£120,000</strong> from their profits to make the place more marketable for their sales teams.</p>\n<p>Please get your thinking caps on and submit your applications to the <a href=\"https://dosomethinggood.ealing.gov.uk/your-voice-your-town/southall-town-team/\">Southall Town Team</a> led by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jags-sanghera-04722153\">Jags Sanghera</a>&hellip; oh, wait, I feel another story coming on!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"methodology-note\">Methodology note</h2>\n<p>All data sourced from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Defra Fly-tipping Statistics 2012–13 to 2023–24</strong> (official government dataset)</li>\n<li><strong>ONS Mid-Year Population Estimates for Ealing</strong> (2012–2018)</li>\n<li>Population estimates for 2019–2024 included in Defra dataset</li>\n<li><strong>Ealing Council enforcement data</strong> (2025, published on council website)</li>\n<li><strong>Ealing Council statements</strong> (2016 cabinet announcements, 2025 media coverage)</li>\n<li>Per capita calculations use ONS mid-year population estimates for each year to control for population growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Caveats</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data crunched with the help of AI.

				"content_text": "This is the shocking story of how for sixteen years Ealing Labour councillors talked rubbish about having to make \"difficult choices\" to cut services to save money, ignoring thousands of residents' protests, and in doing so created a massive mess that a decade later still costs millions to clean up every year and leaves children's and disabled people's lives unnecessarily poorer.  \n\nIt's a story about an ambitious New Labour leader - [politically aligned with Tony Blair](https://southallstories.uk/2025/09/26/ealing-for-sale/) and his campaign director in 1997, the three times disgraced ex-Lord [Peter Mandelson](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/10/peter-mandelson-new-labour-jeffrey-epstein-corporate-power) - who makes bad choices that harm the very people (and their children) who elected him to represent them in Southall Green, one of the poorest council wards in Ealing.  \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260213-094729.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\" alt=\"A LinkedIn post from Peter Mason talking rubbish and discussing a campaign in Ealing to reduce fly-tipping and change resident behavior, highlighting specific achievements and initiatives, signed off with Bangarang.\">  \n\n---\n\nNot only do his bad choices harm vulnerable people who [deserve better](https://open.substack.com/pub/southall/p/southall-deserves-better), Ealing Labour's \"solution\" to the problem they created is to blame and punish their victims - with fewer frontline services they need the most, more authoritarian and privacy-violating surveillance, and harsher financial punishments for and criminalisation of often [unfortunate individuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ealing/s/JD2n25UHIk) who can't afford to pay huge fines, while allowing actual criminal fly-tippers to carry-on and get away scot-free.  \n\n\nSeemingly oblivious (or maybe not) to the chaos and disorder caused, he celebrates spending millions more than he saved on enforcement by trumpeting his \"listening to residents\" and his enforcement \"achievements\" on TV and LinkedIn, signing off with a Boris Johnson-esque \"Bangarang\".\n\n\n---\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/pxl-20260210-115133587.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"451\" alt=\"Ruskin Hall in Acton, Ealing Labour Party's official HQ, with a sign for The Labour Party and some fly-tipped rubbish bags on the pavement out front.\">\n\n\n---\n# Bangarang Pete\n\nEaling Council last week announced their [draft budget](https://www.ealing.news/news/ealing-council-unveils-2026-27-budget-plans/) for the coming financial year 2026-27. Coming just three months before local council elections in May, it is full of what many voters will see as nothing more than simple electoral bribes. \n\n\nEaling Labour Leader Peter Mason hailed it as the first council budget in sixteen years that doesn't cut frontline services such as [social care, schools, housing and planning and waste collection](https://www.local.gov.uk/about/what-local-government). \n\n\nThat's quite an admission. \n\n\nSixteen years of Ealing Labour cutting frontline services as if they were Tories. \n\n\nOf course, Ealing Labour always blamed the national Tory government cuts to local government funding. They had no choice to make the \"difficult choices\" that were effectively imposed upon them by a hard-right Tory central government. \n\n\nWhat else could they do? \n\n\nAt least they did it in a more professional and grown-up way than Ealing Conservatives would have done! \n\n\nAnd let's just pretend that Peter Mason didn't spend much of his time between 2015 and 2019 in cahoots with \"the Dark Lord\" Peter Mandelson - the disgraced best friend of convicted paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein - in trying to undermine Jeremy Corbyn every single day. \n\n\nCorbyn isn't perfect, but a Corbyn-led Labour government in 2019 would certainly have provided [increased funding](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/jeremy-corbyn-urges-public-to-vote-for-his-manifesto-of-hope-labour-tax-spend-plans) to local authorities. \n\n\nInstead, self-identifying \"left-wing\" Mason made the \"difficult choice\" to [withdraw support](https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/statement/a-shameful-day-for-the-jlm/) and effectively hand the election to [known anti-Semite, all-round racist](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/11/boris-johnsons-record-of-bigotry-antisemitism-and-far-right-politics-must-not-be-forgotten), liar and \"killer clown\" Boris Johnson. Never [on your side](https://www.ealinglabour.com/manifesto2022/).\n\n\nAfter Corbyn's successor as Labour Leader Keir Starmer won a landslide General Election last year against a Tory Party reeling after five years of chaos and confusion under Johnson, Truss and Sunak, Mason was clearly delighted to announce additional central government funding. \n\n\nBut with Starmer generating his own chaos by [supporting war crimes by Israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/12/corbyn-alleges-uk-complicity-after-streetings-admission-of-gaza-abuses) and embroiled in [a scandal of his own making](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czej4ep882ko) with his appointment of Peter Mandelson as the British Ambassador to the US despite knowing of [Mandelson's continued friendship with the convicted paedophile Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_of_Peter_Mandelson_and_Jeffrey_Epstein), national Labour's stock is at an all-time low.\n\n\nSimilar to by-elections, local elections are often a convenient opportunity for the general public to voice their frustration with, and opposition to, national government policies and failures with a protest vote against the ruling party. \n\n\nEaling Labour councillors must be very concerned that many of them will lose their [massively increased allowances](https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&spage=common/eacouncil220.htm) in May, thanks to the actions of Starmer's national Labour Party.\n\n\nIn the lead-up to the elections, therefore, their leader Peter Mason has seized the opportunity to take back the local initiative with a financial package of \"improved\" frontline services, including action on fly-tipping.\n\n\nOne of the big local (and national) issues now in Ealing, and especially Southall, is fly-tipping, with the perception across the borough that the problem, while not new, has got significantly worse in recent years.\n\n\n# A quick recap of how we got here\n\n\nIn 2003, \"Filthy streets, dirty parks, a growing drug problem and overcrowding mark Southall as suffering 'inner-city deprivation'\", then [London Mayor Ken Livingstone admitted](https://www.ealingtimes.co.uk/news/54754.southalls-inner-city-deprivation/).\n\n\nAround the same time, Southallians [complained about rubbish and litter](https://web.archive.org/web/20040615012717/http://www.southallgasworks.com/Media/ConsultationReport.pdf) on our streets in response to a consultation on the possible development of the old Southall Gasworks site.\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-2021-08-03-19.47.15.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"287\" alt=\"Southall Gasworks consultation report from April 2003 outlines the perceived negative aspects of Southall in categories such as the environment, with particular reference to Rubbish/litter on streets.\">---\n\n\nIn 2010, soon after Peter Mason arrived in the borough, he was complaining about his new neighbours on Facebook, who - quite possibly - were rooting through his trash in the night:\n> \"How many times must i be woken up by their squeaking?\"\n\n\nRather than set an example and [report a noise nuisance](https://southallstories.uk/2026/01/22/its-never-enough-until-its/) via the council website like a normal person, Mason proposed a [callous, ruthless](https://southallstories.uk/2022/03/19/ealing-labour-leaks/) and deadly violent solution:\n> \"will somebody please shoot these fucking foxes in Acton!\"\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260211-184450.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"464\" alt=\"Peter Mason's Facebook post from 2010 expresses a plea to shoot these fucking foxes in Acton and a fantasy of a fox-hunt through Ealing.\">\n\n\n---\n\n\nIt was after Mason's arrival that Ealing Labour under then leader Julian Bell made the \"difficult choice\" to freeze council tax every year while the national Tory government cut their funding by 60%. \n\n\nOf course, they wanted to protect the majority of people suffering under Tory and LibDem imposed national austerity from having to pay more council tax. But in doing so they reduced further still the amount of money available to sustain local services. \n\n\nCynics might point out that Bell was afraid that raising council tax would be vote loser. Instead, in order to retain power, he made the \"difficult choices\" to raise funds and save money by [selling off Ealing's public assets](https://southallstories.uk/2022/03/25/ealing-monopoly/) and cutting frontline services - including adult social care services in Southall, and a 50% reduction in waste collection across the borough. \n\n\nIn 2015, [residents protested](https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/neighbourly-care-southall-fights-back-9700892) against these cuts outside Ealing Town Hall. Peter Mason, always ready put put his spin on it, tweeted:\n\n\n> \"Some protesting wheelie bins, many more protesting adult social care [sic].

I’m trying my very best.”\n\n\nIt's a not uncommon sight here to see disabled people forced to risk their lives by walking with their mobility aids in the road because the pavements are impassable due to rubbish bags, mattresses, fridges, broken glass, illegally parked cars, and broken pavements.  \n\n\nAlso last year, my brilliant community pharmacist, Rahul Puri, explained the [serious public health harms](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRfJ3fLA/) arising directly as a result of the dramatic rise of fly-tipping in Southall, an area already extremely vulnerable to [health problems](https://southallstories.uk/categories/health/) and stressors.\n\n\n# Fly-tipping doubled when weekly rubbish collections ended in 2016\n\n\n**Official government data shows the number of fly-tipping incidents doubled after 2016 and the introduction of fortnightly wheelie bin collections. Ealing Council's own numbers show it costs millions. And the solution they won't consider would save £1-1.6 million per year.**\n\n\nWhat actually happened is recorded in the government's own statistics: fly-tipping in Ealing doubled overnight and has cost council taxpayers millions every year since.  \n\nThree months after weekly collections ended, the council was already announcing a [fly-tipping crackdown](https://www.aroundealing.com/news/finding-and-fining-the-fly-tippers/). \n\nIn November 2016, it reported that new taskforce crews had visited 763 streets and traced dumped waste back to 1,124 addresses in just three months. The message from cabinet member Bassam Mahfouz was simple: “We will find you and we will fine you.”  \n\n\nThe enforcement narrative was in place almost immediately after the service change - just as the official data shows fly-tipping doubling across the borough. \n\nIt’s hard to escape the impression that the council knew the service change would create a problem and prepared to police the consequences rather than reconsider the policy itself.  \n\n\nSome might argue the rise could simply reflect better reporting rather than more fly-tipping. But the data shows a different pattern. Incidents were stable for years, then almost exactly doubled in the same year weekly collections ended - and have remained at that higher level ever since. \n\nReporting changes usually produce short-term spikes or gradual trends. What Ealing’s figures show is a sudden, permanent step-change, which strongly suggests a real increase in dumping rather than just better record-keeping.\n\nEaling Council now spends **[£3 million annually](https://www.aroundealing.com/news/fly-tippers-pay-for-their-actions/)** clearing fly-tipping whilst claiming the problem is down to residents' behaviour. \n\n\nNow Ealing Southall's MP and formerly Peter Mason's deputy leader of the council, [Deirdre Costigan](https://youtu.be/E_NoNRlJasw) visited Southall Green in March 2022 to launch yet another ineffective authoritarian pre-election crackdown on fly-tipping. \n\nCostigan said, \"I'm here in Southall today with our fly-tip enforcement and clearing team to talk about our new zero tolerance approach to illegal dumping. Ealing is a brilliant place to live but a small minority of people spoil things for the rest of us by fly tipping in our borough.\" \n\n\nShe claimed that this small minority of people in Southall \"don't play by the rules\" and that their actions are \"disgusting, irresponsible and illegal.\" She also states that the council's CCTV surveillance and enforcement mechanisms are inadequate.\n\n\nBut the government data tells a different story: **Ealing Council created the problem, spent ten years managing the symptoms, and refuses to consider the solution because it would mean admitting the original policy was a catastrophic mistake.**\n\n\n# What the official data shows\n\n\nThe table below uses [Defra's national fly-tipping dataset](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-statistics-for-england), with population-adjusted rates per 1,000 residents to control for population growth.\n\n\n| Year | Total Incidents | Population | Incidents per 1,000 residents |\n|------|----------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| 2012–13 | 6,352 | 336,900 | 18.9 |\n| 2013–14 | 5,765 | 338,000 | 17.1 |\n| 2014–15 | 7,257 | 339,000 | 21.4 |\n| 2015–16 | 7,032 | 339,700 | 20.7 |\n| **2016–17** | **14,270** | **340,000** | **42.0** |\n| 2017–18 | 13,610 | 340,500 | 40.0 |\n| 2019–20 | 13,115 | 341,806 | 38.4 |\n| 2020–21 | 13,090 | 340,341 | 38.5 |\n| 2021–22 | 12,303 | 366,762 | 33.5 |\n| 2022–23 | 12,922 | 369,937 | 34.9 |\n| 2023–24 | 16,828 | 375,340 | 44.8 |\n\n\n**The pattern is undeniable:**\n\n\n- **Four years of stability** (2012–16): Fly-tipping averaged 17–21 incidents per 1,000 residents  \n- **One year of catastrophe** (2016–17): Jumped to 42 incidents per 1,000 residents  \n- **Eight years of plateau** (2017–24): Remained at 33–45 incidents per 1,000 residents  \n\n\n**That's a 137% increase per person** from 2012–13 to 2023–24.\n\n\nThis isn't explained by population growth. Even after adjusting for population, fly-tipping has more than doubled per resident.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The structural break\n\n\nFor data analysts, this is what a \"structural break\" looks like — a sudden, permanent shift in the underlying pattern that points to a specific policy change rather than gradual social trends.\n\n\n**Year-on-year changes show the exact moment:**\n\n\n- 2012–13 → 2013–14: -587 incidents (-9.2%)  \n- 2013–14 → 2014–15: +1,492 incidents (+25.9%)  \n- 2014–15 → 2015–16: -225 incidents (-3.1%)  \n\n\n**Then wheelie bins and fortnightly collections were introduced in June 2016:**\n\n\n- **2015–16 → 2016–17: +7,238 incidents (+102.9%)**\n\n\n**Followed by stabilisation at the new, much higher level:**\n\n\n- 2016–17 → 2017–18: -660 incidents (-4.6%)  \n- 2017–18 → 2019–20: -495 incidents (-3.6%)  \n- 2019–20 → 2020–21: -25 incidents (-0.2%)  \n- 2020–21 → 2021–22: -787 incidents (-6.0%)  \n- 2021–22 → 2022–23: +619 incidents (+5.0%)  \n- 2022–23 → 2023–24: +3,906 incidents (+30.2%)  \n\n\n---\n\n\n# What the council promised\n\n\nIn March 2016, Cabinet Member Bassam Mahfouz announced the switch to fortnightly collections and wheelie bins:\n\n\n> \"Wheelie bins will make it easier for people to recycle more meaning less waste will be sent to landfill, and they will also **keep our streets cleaner** by cutting down on the number of black bags ripped open by foxes.\"\n\n\nThe council claimed the changes would:\n- Save around £1.7 million per year  \n- Increase recycling rates  \n- Reduce street mess  \n- Improve cleanliness  \n\n\n---\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/file-00000000d0a87246a03e592b765cc8b8.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"A fox sniffs at garbage bags on the left pre-2016, while two rats are near massively overflowing wheelie bins on the right, post-2016.\">\n\n\n---\n\n\n# What actually happened\n\n\n**Fly-tipping per resident almost exactly doubled** in the year after the policy was introduced.\n\n\n**Streets got objectively dirtier** — by every measurable metric.\n\n\n**The rate has never returned to pre-2016 levels** — eight years later, fly-tipping remains approximately double what it was.\n\n\n**In 2023–24, the rate hit 44.8 per 1,000** — the highest on record, more than double the pre-2016 average.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**The residents who predicted the disaster have been proven right by eight years of data.**\n\n\n**The council that promised cleaner streets has delivered the opposite.**\n\n\nIf only the council actually [listened to the residents](https://open.substack.com/pub/southall/p/real-change-not-empty-consultations)!\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The timing problem for other explanations\n\n\nSome might blame the rise in fly-tipping on demographic change, population growth, or changing social attitudes.\n\n\nBut the data demolishes these explanations:\n\n\n**Demographic change happens gradually.** It doesn't produce a one-year doubling across an entire borough.\n\n\n**Population growth is accounted for.** These figures are per 1,000 residents — they already control for population increases.\n\n\n**Social trends develop slowly.** They don't create structural breaks where behaviour doubles in twelve months.\n\n\nThe data shows:\n- Stable pattern for years  \n- Sudden doubling in the exact year the waste collection system changed  \n- Permanent plateau at the new level  \n\n\n**That's the signature of a policy shock, not a social trend.**\n\nThe borough-wide collection frequency change is the only factor that aligns precisely with the timing and scale of the increase.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The false economy\n\n\nThe council claimed fortnightly collections would save £1.7 million per year, rising to £2.3 million.\n\n\n**But fly-tipping isn't free.**\n\n\n## The current annual cost\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/20260208-234604.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"848\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Ealing's enforcement activity report details monthly fly-tipping fines issued from January 2023, totaling 3,328 fines with an 11.09% issuance rate.\">\n\n\n---\n\n\nIn June 2025, Ealing Council admitted that **illegal dumping costs the borough £3 million a year.**\n\n\nThe council's own 2025 enforcement data shows:\n- 30,000 fly-tip reports  \n- 3,328 fines issued  \n- 11.09% enforcement rate  \n\n\n## Fine income vs clearance costs\n\n\nThe council issues fines of up to £1,000 for fly-tipping, but most enforcement uses Fixed Penalty Notices typically ranging from £400–£1,000.\n\n\n**Conservative estimate (£400 average fine):**\n- 3,328 fines × £400 = £1.33 million income  \n\n\n**Mid-range estimate (£600 average fine):**\n- 3,328 fines × £600 = £2.0 million income  \n\n\n**Net taxpayer cost:**\n\n\n| Category | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| Annual clearance costs | £3.0 million |\n| Fine income (low estimate) | £1.33 million |\n| Fine income (mid estimate) | £2.0 million |\n| **Net public cost** | **£1.0–£1.7 million per year** |\n\n\n## Cost per incident\n\n\nWith 16,828 incidents (2023–24) and £3 million annual cost:\n\n\n**£3,000,000 ÷ 16,828 = £178 per incident**\n\n\nThis covers collection labour, vehicles, disposal fees, investigation, enforcement, administration, and legal costs.\n\n\n## The 13-year comparison\n\n\n**Before wheelie bins (2012–16 average):**\n- Clearance costs: ~£430,000 annually  \n- Fine income: ~£149,000 annually  \n- **Net cost: ~£281,000 annually**  \n\n\n**After wheelie bins (2025):**\n- Clearance costs: £3,000,000 annually  \n- Fine income: £1,330,000–£2,000,000 annually  \n- **Net cost: £1,000,000–£1,700,000 annually**  \n\n\n**The increase:**\n- Clearance costs: **+£2.57 million annually** (+597%)  \n- Net taxpayer cost: **+£719,000–£1,420,000 annually** (+256–505%)  \n\n\n## The cumulative damage\n\n\nFrom 2016–17 to 2023–24, Ealing recorded **108,015 total fly-tipping incidents.**\n\n\nFrom 2012–13 to 2015–16, Ealing recorded **26,406 total incidents.**\n\n\n**That's 81,609 additional incidents over eight years** compared to pre-wheelie bin rates.\n\n\nEven at the conservative clearance cost of £178 per incident, that's **£14.5 million in additional fly-tipping costs** since the policy change.\n\n\n**The claimed £1.7 million annual savings?** \n\n\n**Wiped out more than eight times over.**\n\n\n---\n\n\n## The enforcement paradox\n\n\nYou might argue that enforcement has improved, so comparing to pre-2016 isn't fair.\n\n\n**The data proves this defence is worthless:**\n\n\n**2012–16 average:**\n- Fine recovery rate: ~34% of clearance costs  \n\n\n**2025:**\n- Fine recovery rate: ~44–67% of clearance costs  \n\n\n**So yes, enforcement has significantly improved.**\n\n\n**But the total volume has increased so much that even with better recovery rates, taxpayers now pay £1–1.7 million annually vs £281,000 pre-2016.**\n\n\nBetter enforcement of a much worse problem still costs far more than preventing the problem in the first place.\n\n\n**Ealing Labour's rubbish collection scheme doubled fly-tipping and cost eight times more to clean up the mess they created than they saved by stopping weekly waste removal**\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The perverse incentive\n\n\nHere's where it gets darkly absurd.\n\n\nIf the council actually collected the maximum £1,000 fine for all 3,328 enforcement actions:\n\n\n**Fine income: £3,328,000**  \n**Clearance costs: £3,000,000**  \n**Net profit: £328,000**\n\n\n**The council would be making money from fly-tipping.**\n\n\nNow, they're not actually collecting £1,000 per fine — most are Fixed Penalty Notices at lower amounts, and many go unpaid. But the theoretical possibility exists.\n\n\n**And that creates a perverse incentive:**\n\n\nThe more fly-tipping occurs, the more enforcement opportunities exist, the more fine income potentially flows in.\n\n\n**It's like something out of Catch-22.**\n\n\nMilo Minderbinder would be proud: create a problem through policy change, establish an enforcement regime, generate revenue from the problem you created, claim you're \"tackling\" the issue whilst financially benefiting from its continuation.\n\n\n**Everyone in the syndicate gets richer — except the residents whose streets are covered in rubbish and who are paying for enforcement through their council tax.**\n\n\n# The children's centres connection\n\n\nIn 2023–24, Ealing Council began consulting on closing 10 of the borough's 25 [children's centres](https://southallstories.uk/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local/), claiming budget pressures.\n\n\nThe projected savings? Around £1 million annually.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the council:\n- Spends £3 million clearing fly-tipping (a problem they created)  \n- Spends £1.9 million on enforcement  \n- Could save £1–1.6 million by returning to weekly collections\n- But won't, because it would mean admitting the 2016 policy failed  \n\n\n**So let's get this straight:**\n\n\n**Can't afford:** £1 million to keep children's centres open for vulnerable families  \n**Can afford:** £3 million clearing fly-tipping + £1.9 million enforcement, both addressing a problem the council created and refuses to fix  \n**Could save:** £1–1.6 million annually by reversing the policy that caused the problem  \n**But won't:** Because political pride is apparently worth more than children's services  \n\n\nAll while justifying [massive pay rises for ineffective and wasteful councillors](https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&spage=common/eacouncil220.htm) that cost over a million pounds in four years. That's enough to pay for all the children's centres. \n\n\n# The Milo Minderbinder business model\n\n\nIf you're not familiar with Catch-22, Milo Minderbinder is the mess officer who runs a syndicate that profits from the war by trading with both sides, eventually bombing his own base because the Germans paid him to do it. Everyone is a member of the syndicate, so everyone benefits. Some more than others.\n\n\n**Ealing's version:**\n\n\n1. **Create the problem:** Switch to fortnightly collections (save £1.7m)  \n2. **Problem doubles:** Fly-tipping increases 100%  \n3. **Monetise the problem:** Enforcement regime generates fine income  \n4. **Claim success:** \"55% reduction in target areas! We're cracking down!\"  \n5. **Never fix the root cause:** Because the enforcement regime is now part of the budget model  \n6. **Close children's centres:** Can't afford services, must \"manage budget pressures\"  \n7. **Everyone in the syndicate benefits:** Except residents living with the rubbish and paying council tax for both the clearance and the enforcement  \n\n\n**We just need to dump enough rubbish to earn enough money to keep the children's centres open!**\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260210-215538.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"960\" alt=\"Former Ealing Council leader Julian Bell in brand new spotlessly clean high-visibility clothing is pulling a wheelie bin full of cash along a residential street, with a tweet discussing recycling targets and saving £2.2m.\">_Former Ealing Council leader Julian Bell in brand new spotlessly clean high-visibility clothing is pulling a wheelie bin full of cash?_\n---\n\nMilo would absolutely pitch this:\n\n\n> \"See, it's really quite simple. We save money by collecting rubbish less frequently. This creates more fly-tipping. We then fine people for fly-tipping. The fines pay for enforcement. The enforcement creates more fines. Eventually, if we get enough rubbish on the streets, we'll be making a profit! Then we can afford frontline services again. Everyone benefits from the syndicate.\"\n\n\n**The only flaw in the plan:** You have to live in a borough covered in fly-tipped rubbish whilst paying council tax for both the clearance and enforcement of a problem your council created and profits from.\n\n\nBut hey, **bangarang, Pete. The syndicate thanks you for your service.**. \n\n\n# The solution they won't consider\n\nIn January 2026, Council Leader [Peter Mason](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1ZcEq2oPo2/) appeared on BBC Politics London to discuss the council's fly-tipping enforcement campaign.\n\nOn [LinkedIn, he boasted](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peter-mason-5a377941_i-was-on-bbc-politics-london-this-morning-activity-7403388834643857408-VXEM):\n\n> \"We've been running a campaign across Ealing this year aimed at changing behaviour: to increase resident awareness and reporting, and to crack down on fly tips. It's working.\n>\n> - 55% decrease in fly tips in our target areas\n> - Increased our maximum fine to £1,000\n> - Issued almost 2,000 fixed penalty notices in the last 6 months alone\n> - Deployed extra CCTV cameras, which have identified 20 persistent criminal waster vehicles that we are now going after\n> - Naming and Shaming on our website leading to positive identifications\"\n\nHe concluded: **\"Bangarang.\"**\n\nBangarang indeed.  \n\n\n**Here's the obvious question Peter Mason won't answer:**\n\n\n**If enforcement campaigns can achieve 55% reduction in target areas at a cost of £1.9 million, why not reverse the policy that caused the 100% increase everywhere?**\n\n\n## The economic comparison\n\n\n**Current approach (2026 budget):**\n\n\n| Category | Annual Cost |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Enforcement budget | £1,910,000 |\n| Clearance costs | £3,000,000 |\n| Fine income | -£1,330,000 to -£2,000,000 |\n| **Net cost to taxpayers** | **£2,910,000–£3,580,000** |\n\n\n**Achievement:** 55% reduction in target areas only (not borough-wide)  \n**Cost per prevented incident:** ~£868  \n\n\n---\n\n\n**Return to weekly collections (estimated):**\n\n\n| Category | Annual Cost |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Additional collection cost vs fortnightly | £1,700,000 |\n| Clearance (at 2012–16 levels) | £430,000 |\n| Fine income (at 2012–16 levels) | -£149,000 |\n| **Net cost to taxpayers** | **£1,981,000** |\n\n\n**Expected result:** Return to pre-2016 baseline (~7,000 incidents vs current ~16,000)  \n**Cost per prevented incident:** ~£189  \n\n\n---\n\n\n**Annual saving from weekly collections: £929,000–£1,599,000**\n\n\n**Service improvement is 4.6 times more cost-effective than enforcement.**\n\n\n## The full comparison\n\n\n| Metric | Pre-2016 (Weekly) | 2025–26 (Fortnightly + Enforcement) | Return to Weekly (Estimated) |\n|--------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Collection frequency** | Weekly | Fortnightly | Weekly |\n| **Annual incidents** | ~7,000 | ~16,000 | ~7,000 |\n| **Incidents per 1,000** | ~21 | ~40–45 | ~21 |\n| **Clearance cost** | ~£430k | £3,000k | ~£430k |\n| **Enforcement cost** | Minimal | £1,910k | Minimal |\n| **Fine income** | ~-£149k | -£1,330k to -£2,000k | ~-£149k |\n| **Net taxpayer cost** | ~£281k | £2,910k–£3,580k | ~£1,981k |\n| **Cost per prevented incident** | N/A (baseline) | £868 (target areas) | £189 (borough-wide) |\n| **Annual saving vs current** | N/A | N/A | **£929k–£1,599k** |\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Preventing the problem vs managing the symptoms\n\n\n**Weekly collections:**\n- Cost: £1.7 million more than fortnightly  \n- Benefit: Prevents ~9,000 fly-tipping incidents  \n- Net effect: Saves £0.9–1.6 million annually vs current approach  \n- Addresses: Root cause  \n\n\n**Current enforcement:**\n- Cost: £1.9 million in enforcement alone  \n- Benefit: 55% reduction in target areas only  \n- Net effect: Costs £0.9–1.6 million more annually than prevention  \n- Addresses: Symptoms whilst cause continues  \n\n\n**Put simply:**\n\n\n**Preventing the problem would cost £1–1.6 million less per year than managing it.**\n\n\nBut that would require admitting the 2016 policy was a mistake.\n\n\nAnd apparently, protecting political face is worth £1–1.6 million of taxpayers' money annually.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# The pattern\n\n\nThis fits Ealing Council's broader modus operandi:\n\n\n**1. Policy imposed without genuine consultation**  \nOver 7,000 residents signed a petition against wheelie bins. The council ignored them and implemented the policy anyway.\n\n\n**2. Environmental rhetoric masking cost-cutting**  \nPromised \"cleaner streets\" whilst implementing cost-saving measures that created the opposite outcome.\n\n\n\n**3. Costs externalised onto residents**  \nFortnightly collections create storage problems in terraced housing, HMOs and all the new tower blocks (Southall's predominant housing types). Residents bear the burden whilst council claims savings.\n\n\n**4. Claims contradicted by measurable outcomes**  \nPromised streets would be \"cleaner.\" Data shows fly-tipping doubled and remained at that level for ten years.\n\n\n**5. Blame shifted to residents**  \nWhen policy causes problem, council blames \"behaviour\" and \"awareness\" rather than examining whether the policy itself failed.\n\n\n**6. Expensive symptom management instead of admitting failure**  \nSpend £1.9 million on enforcement rather than £1.7 million on service improvement, because the latter would require admitting the original policy was wrong.\n\n\n**7. No outcomes evaluation**  \nReport activity statistics (investigations, fines, warnings) without ever asking: \"Did the policy we implemented in 2016 cause the doubling? Should we reverse it?\"\n\n\n---\n\n\n# What this proves\n\n\n**1. The data is undeniable**  \nFly-tipping per resident almost exactly doubled in the year after fortnightly collections were introduced. No other borough-wide change explains the timing or scale.\n\n\n**2. The cost is substantial**  \n£14.5 million in additional clearance costs over eight years, plus £1.9 million annual enforcement spending, far exceeds the claimed £1.7 million annual savings.\n\n\n**3. The solution is obvious**  \nReturn to weekly collections. It would be cheaper, more effective, and address the root cause rather than managing symptoms.\n\n\n**4. The political calculation is clear**  \nThe council prioritises avoiding admission of policy failure over fiscal responsibility and effectiveness.\n\n\n**5. Residents were right all along**  \nThe 7,000+ people who opposed wheelie bins, the residents who predicted fly-tipping would increase, the community members who've complained for ten years — they were all correct.\n\n\n**6. The council's approach to evidence**  \nWhen data contradicts promises, ignore the data, blame residents, and spend millions managing the problem you created rather than reversing the policy that caused it.\n\n\n---\n# Where are we now?\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/yvyt-southall-flyer.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"764\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: An advertisement encourages community members to submit ideas to improve Southall, featuring images of people shopping and sitting, and provides a QR code and website for more information.\">\n\n\n---\n\n\nNow, if anyone has any bright ideas about how to make Southall cleaner and more pleasant, the mega rich developers building more than ten thousand new homes in tens of new tower blocks have kindly given us **£120,000** from their profits to make the place more marketable for their sales teams.\n\n\nPlease get your thinking caps on and submit your applications to the [Southall Town Team](https://dosomethinggood.ealing.gov.uk/your-voice-your-town/southall-town-team/) led by [Jags Sanghera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jags-sanghera-04722153)... oh, wait, I feel another story coming on!\n\n---\n\n\n## Methodology note\n\n\nAll data sourced from:\n- **Defra Fly-tipping Statistics 2012–13 to 2023–24** (official government dataset)  \n- **ONS Mid-Year Population Estimates for Ealing** (2012–2018)  \n- Population estimates for 2019–2024 included in Defra dataset  \n- **Ealing Council enforcement data** (2025, published on council website)  \n- **Ealing Council statements** (2016 cabinet announcements, 2025 media coverage)  \n- Per capita calculations use ONS mid-year population estimates for each year to control for population growth.   \n\n_Caveats_:\n- Data crunched with the help of AI. I checked the headline data, but if you see any mistakes, human or otherwise, please let me know.  \n- There could be other causes of the increase in fly-tipping. The data clearly shows a doubling of fly-tipping incidents immediately after weekly refuse collections were replaced with fortnightly general waste collections.  \n- As a friend said to me, we need more bins, more collections, free disposal of bulky waste and recycling items, targeting of illegal dumping by organised rogue waste disposal and clearance companies and unscrupulous HMO landlords, and more education and support about what's acceptable waste disposal and what isn't.  \n- Enfield Council switched from weekly to fortnightly bin collections in 2019. The data from Enfield doesn't show the same dramatic shift as it does in Ealing, but residents there are complaining of [increased fly-tipping](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/residents-left-fuming-after-changes-32662715) and asking for a return of weekly collections.\n",

[SATIRE]\">\n\n--- \n\n\n### Invocation  \nSing, website, sing.  \nOf forms and thresholds, boxes small,  \nof windows that open into darkness,  \nof daytime hotlines that take you to voicemail  \nby those who never lived the night.\n\n\nSing of a citizen with sleep in debt,  \nwho brings a sound, a smell, a (non-epileptic) tremor  \nto the gates of order —  \nand finds, beyond the gate,  \nonly more order.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## I. The Omen  \nIt starts with **noise** —  \nThe drilling; the forklift trucks; the alarms;\nindustrial skips emptied like thunderclaps, \nall in the early hours.\n\n\nOr it starts with **smell** —  \npetrol and tar-sweet, smoke and solvent-bitter,  \na breath that arrives to wake you from sleep.\n\n\nOr **dust**, settling quietly into lungs and windowsills.  \nOr **vibration**, shuddering through walls,  \nloosening fixtures, rattling bones.  \nOr **damage**, hairline cracks creeping across ceilings,  \ncupboards that no longer close,  \ndoors that unhinge, like minds.\n\n\nOr all of them at once —  \nfor the world is rarely polite enough  \nto separate its harms by department.\n\n\nYou close the windows.  \nYou reopen them.  \nYou learn the wind direction by its cruelty.  \nYou time your life around someone else’s activity  \nuntil time itself becomes the nuisance.\n\n\nThen, like a dutiful soul,  \nyou decide to report it.\n\n\nAnd thus you step onto the path.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## II. The Naming of the Thing  \nFirst comes the rite of precision.\n\n\n**Name it**, says the Council.  \nName it as the system prefers to hear it.\n\n\nIf **Noise** —  \nis it neighbour? is it construction?  \nis it commercial, industrial, or “other”?\n\n\nIf **Odour** —  \nis it dust, fumes, emissions, cooking,  \nhistoric contamination, or something else entirely?\n\n\nIf **Air Pollution** —  \nis it a vehicle, a business, a development site,  \na legacy issue, or a statistical abstraction?\n\n\nIf **Vibration** —  \nis it perceptible, measurable, structural,  \nor merely felt?\n\n\nIf **Damage** —  \ncan it be proven to have happened *after*  \nthe works began?\n\n\nYou raise one hand:  \n> *It is one thing. It is ruining my life.*\n\n\nThe system raises two:  \n> *It is many things. Choose one.*\n\n\nChoose carefully.  \nChoosing wrong does not produce an error message.  \nIt produces silence.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## III. The Windows of Opportunity  \nNow seek the window.\n\n\nThere are many windows.  \nThey are all clearly labelled.  \nThey all lead somewhere else.\n\n\nSome windows lead to pages  \nthat define what *might* count as a nuisance,  \nwithout explaining how to report one.\n\n\nSome lead to forms —  \nonline, downloadable, printable —  \nwhich shrink your story into boxes  \nuntil your distress becomes a checkbox.\n\n\nSome lead to email addresses  \nwhich accept your message  \nas the relentless beeping saps your attention.\n\n\nSome lead to phone numbers  \nanswered by recorded message in office hours  \nwhile the nuisance performs  \nits finest work at night.\n\n\nNone of the windows say what happens next.  \nNone of them say who holds the keys.  \nNone of them say how long the corridor is.\nPlease do not close this window.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## IV. The Citizen Learns Their Role  \nHere is the truth, spoken softly:\n\n\nYou are not a complainant.  \nYou are a **data point**.\n\n\nBut not the useful kind.\n\n\nYour report may be logged.  \nOr counted.  \nOr categorised into a cousin-category  \nand thereby never counted at all.\n\n\nIt may be assessed,  \nunless it is deemed anecdotal.\n\n\nIt may be investigated,  \nunless thresholds are not met.\n\n\nYou will not be told which.  \nThat would create obligation.\n\n\nInstead you are given tasks,  \nas a monk is given beads:\n\n\nKeep a diary.  \nRecord dates.  \nRecord times.  \nDescribe frequency.  \nMeasure impact.  \nPhotograph cracks.  \nFilm vibrations.  \nCollect dust in bags.\n\n\nYou gather.  \nYou document.  \nYou comply.\n\n\nAnd waiting becomes your new address.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## V. The Hymn of Reassurance  \nSomewhere along the way  \na scroll appears: reassurance, stamped and calm.\n\n\nIt sings the same four lines:\n\n\n- monitoring is taking place  \n- regulators are satisfied  \n- levels are within guidelines\n(and, when they're not)\n- it's not harmful to health  \n\nSometimes a fifth line is added, _sotto voce_:  \n> *There’s a housing crisis. There's nothing we can do.*\n\n\nThe reassurance does not mention you.  \nIt does not cite your report.  \nIt does not say whether your suffering  \nwas counted as signal or written off as noise.\nBut if it does, it says:\n> *You're evidence is unscientific and unverified.*\n\nIt does not clarify  \nwho is responsible now,  \nor later,  \nor whether responsibility has moved  \nlike jumpers for goalposts.\n\n\nIt exists parallel to your life —  \nnot in response to it.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## VI. The Optional Quest of Persistence  \nIf you persist, you begin to see.\n\n\nNoise is treated separately from odour,  \neven if they break into your home together.\n\n\nOdour is treated separately from air pollution,  \neven when they choke the same throat.\n\n\nDust is treated as temporary.  \nVibration is treated as subjective.  \nDamage is treated as pre-existing.\n\n\nSite-specific issues are treated separately  \nfrom general complaints,  \neven when they are reported by the same residents  \nabout the same place  \nfor the same years.\n\nMeetings are organised.\nHundreds may complain about the same thing.\nBut they do not count.\nEach incident must be logged separately.\nNot by email, or on social media.\n\nEach nuisance report must be isolated from every other.\nInvestigated hours or days later.\nYour lived experience.\nVerified by trained professionals.\nPlease complete [this form](http://nuisance.southallstories.uk/).\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2026/screenshot-20260120-231400.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"719\" alt=\"Ealing Council's website interface offers options to report noise nuisances, including noise, odor, or a combination of issues, with links for further information and guidance.

The First Prophecy  \nEventually, one of two endings approaches:\n\n\nEither the nuisance stops —  \ntemporarily, unpredictably, without explanation —  \nlike a beast wandering out of sight.\n\n\nOr you stop reporting it —  \nbecause you are tired,  \nor busy,  \nor worn down enough  \nto accept the phrase *“within acceptable limits”*  \nas a lifestyle.\n\n\nFrom the outside, these endings look identical.\n\n\nComplaint levels fall.  \nData improves.  \nThe system records success.\n\n\nOnly your life, what's left of it, remembers what happened.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## VIII. A Note on Responsibility (the Smokescreen Chapter)  \nAt no point are you told clearly  \nwhether your report is handled by:\n\n\nEnvironmental Health,  \nPollution Control,  \nPlanning Enforcement,  \nthe Council,  \nor the Environment Agency.\n\n\nYou may be told — encouragingly —  \nthat it is “good” you are reporting so much.\n\n\nYou have to explain, patiently,  \nthat no, it is bad.  \nBad that so many reports are necessary.  \nBad that so many incidents exist to be reported.\n\n\nThis clarification is noted.  \nNothing changes.\n\n\nThe ambiguity is presented as complexity.  \nIn practice, it is insulation.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## IX.

The Real Correction  \nA subtle shift, almost invisible:\n\n\nThe sound does not change.  \nThe smell does not change.  \nThe dust still settles.  \nThe walls still tremble.  \nThe cracks still widen.\n\n\nWhat changes is the story told about it.\n\n\nThe problem is no longer the nuisance.  \nThe problem is the person who keeps noticing.\n\n\nYou are now:\n\n\n- persistent  \n- difficult  \n- overly detailed  \n- emotionally involved  \n- **a sensitive receptor**\n(\"fucking moaners!\")\n\n\nYou are advised to be patient.  \nYou are thanked for your engagement.  \nYou are reassured.\n\nIf you do not retract your frustration,\nThe council may begin legal proceedings against you.\n\n\nAnd the system begins to treat you  \nas the anomaly it must manage.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## XI.

That&rsquo;s What Makes It Worse.</h1>\n<p><strong>A response to &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t the council investigate?&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>Following publication of my article on the <a href=\"https://southallstories.uk/2026/01/12/a-fire-we-were-warned/\">Johnson Street fire</a>, a reader asked: &ldquo;Why did no one from the council check it out?&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>The answer is more disturbing than regulatory neglect.</p>\n<p><strong>They did check it out.</strong></p>\n<p>They conducted almost <strong>a year-long investigation</strong>.</p>\n<p>They made site visits. They reviewed evidence.</p>\n<p>And then <strong>they claimed to find nothing</strong>.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t a story about authorities failing to investigate. It&rsquo;s about what happens when investigation becomes a tool for managing complaints rather than addressing harm.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-actually-happened-a-timeline\">What Actually Happened: A Timeline</h1>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p><strong>March 2022</strong>: I contacted Ealing Council about incinerators at Sam&rsquo;s Recycling and neighbouring units on Johnson Street, asking whether environmental permits were in place.</p>\n<p><strong>March 2022</strong>: The Council&rsquo;s Environmental Protection Officer responded that the business didn&rsquo;t require an environmental permit, and that <strong>there had been &ldquo;no complaints&rdquo;</strong> between April 2017 and June 2021.</p>\n<p>He added reassurance: the council had appointed a dedicated Environmental Health Officer conducting ongoing assessments since late 2021. The outcomes &ldquo;support findings of historical complaints data.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In other words: <strong>We&rsquo;re investigating. We&rsquo;ve found nothing.</strong></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p><strong>August 2022</strong>: After experiencing strong burning plastic odours entering my home, I visited the site and submitted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Photographs showing open burning</li>\n<li>Video evidence of poorly managed operations</li>\n<li>Written testimony documenting burning of treated wooden pallets and melamine-coated particle board</li>\n<li>Evidence of unrestricted public access from residential street where children play</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I explicitly noted the site appeared to be &ldquo;effectively an open fire&rdquo; with serious fire risk implications.</p>\n<p><strong>September 2022</strong>: No response. I requested acknowledgement.</p>\n<p><strong>October 2022</strong>: Council response arrived. The Environmental Protection Manager explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Council&rsquo;s odour assessments, between Sep 2021 and June 2022, have not identified or witnessed presence of statutory nuisance at the complainants' addresses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The council had conducted almost a <strong>year-long daily investigation</strong> in response to complaints (though they&rsquo;d previously stated there were &ldquo;no complaints&rdquo;). Despite this year-long effort, investigating officers were &ldquo;unable to verify any odour nuisance, or enforce better practices.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The council would, however, write to businesses requesting they explore &ldquo;additional best practicable means&rdquo; to reduce emissions.</p>\n<p><strong>November 2022</strong>: I requested a copy of this letter. No response.</p>\n<p><strong>February 2023</strong>: Three months later, still no response. I visited the site again and reported the incinerator at Sam&rsquo;s Recycling appeared to have been enclosed with corrugated sheets - possibly removed or being replaced.</p>\n<p><strong>March 2023</strong>: Council responded with links to Environment Agency permit registrations for the sites. However, as I noted, these permits didn&rsquo;t mention waste incineration or incinerator use.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p><strong>August 2023</strong>: After nearly 18 months of correspondence, I summarised my understanding in a detailed email. Point 15 stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that your investigative techniques, however improved you claim them to be, aren&rsquo;t actually any good at all, and <strong>perhaps are designed to be that way</strong>. After all, if you could &lsquo;verify&rsquo; what I and other residents tell you, then you might have to take enforcement action.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>September 2023</strong>: No response. I requested acknowledgement.</p>\n<p><strong>January 2024</strong>: I escalated to formal complaint, noting it had been over four months since my August email with no acknowledgement, &ldquo;let alone any response.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>According to the council&rsquo;s complaints policy, I should have received acknowledgement within four days and a Stage One response within twenty days.</p>\n<p><strong>January 2024</strong>: Three weeks later, still no acknowledgement. I noted the breach of complaints policy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>January 2026</strong>: A devastating fire guts the site causing over half a million pounds worth of damages according to the owner when I spoke to him.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-investigation-that-found-nothing\">The Investigation That Found Nothing</h1>\n<p>So what happened during that almost year-long &ldquo;daily investigation&rdquo; between September 2021 and June 2022?</p>\n<p>According to the council:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No evidence of statutory odour nuisance was identified</li>\n<li>Officers were unable to verify any odour nuisance</li>\n<li>Officers were unable to enforce better practices</li>\n<li>Initial indications suggested odour intensity and chemical concentrations were &ldquo;well below national and international standards&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Meanwhile, in just two or three visits made in response to strong burning plastic odours entering my home, I documented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open or poorly enclosed incineration</li>\n<li>Burning of treated wood, melamine, and plastic waste</li>\n<li>Smoke plumes affecting residential areas</li>\n<li>Unsafe waste handling and storage</li>\n<li>Explicit fire risk from poor management</li>\n<li>Unrestricted public access where children play</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"the-methodology-gap\">The Methodology Gap</h1>\n<p>How is it possible for a year-long daily investigation by trained professionals to find no evidence of problems that a resident documented in three visits?</p>\n<p><strong>Three possibilities:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>I fabricated evidence.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The photographs and video are fake.

The fire occurred exactly as the evidence suggested it would.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t believe council investigators are universally incompetent. Some may be excellent at their jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>That leaves the third option.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"what-investigation-actually-means\">What &ldquo;Investigation&rdquo; Actually Means</h1>\n<p>The year-long investigation wasn&rsquo;t designed to establish whether harmful practices were occurring. It was designed to establish whether those practices met the specific legal threshold of &ldquo;statutory nuisance&rdquo; sufficient to trigger enforcement action.</p>\n<p>These are not the same thing.</p>\n<p>Harmful practices can continue indefinitely without meeting statutory nuisance thresholds, particularly when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investigation methodologies require direct witnessing at specific moments</li>\n<li>Odour assessments depend on subjective officer judgment at time of visit</li>\n<li>Chemical monitoring is time-limited and may miss peak exposures</li>\n<li>Regulatory frameworks create jurisdictional confusion</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Best practice&rdquo; letters substitute for enforcement action</li>\n<li>Complaints are acknowledged but not acted upon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result is a system that generates impressive paperwork - year-long investigations!

				"content_text": "# They Did Check It Out. That's What Makes It Worse.\n\n\n**A response to \"Why didn't the council investigate?\"**\n\n\nFollowing publication of my article on the [Johnson Street fire](https://southallstories.uk/2026/01/12/a-fire-we-were-warned/), a reader asked: \"Why did no one from the council check it out?\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/pxl-20221018-080204539.mp.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"A trailer filled with plastic bags is parked in Sam's Recycling yard in Southall with a worker nearby and smoke rising from the incinerator chimney.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\nThe answer is more disturbing than regulatory neglect. \n\n\n**They did check it out.** \n\n\nThey conducted almost **a year-long investigation**. \n\n\nThey made site visits. They reviewed evidence. \n\n\nAnd then **they claimed to find nothing**.\n\n\nThis isn't a story about authorities failing to investigate. It's about what happens when investigation becomes a tool for managing complaints rather than addressing harm.\n\n\n# What Actually Happened: A Timeline\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/20260115-234325-collage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two documents with redacted text are overlaid on a white background.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\n**March 2022**: I contacted Ealing Council about incinerators at Sam's Recycling and neighbouring units on Johnson Street, asking whether environmental permits were in place.\n\n\n**March 2022**: The Council's Environmental Protection Officer responded that the business didn't require an environmental permit, and that **there had been \"no complaints\"** between April 2017 and June 2021.\n\n\nHe added reassurance: the council had appointed a dedicated Environmental Health Officer conducting ongoing assessments since late 2021. The outcomes \"support findings of historical complaints data.\"\n\n\nIn other words: **We're investigating. We've found nothing.**\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/311305860-1537535190044968-2516886804612267600-n.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A large outdoor incinerator is actively burning scraps of wood and other materials, with visible flames and smoke.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\n**August 2022**: After experiencing strong burning plastic odours entering my home, I visited the site and submitted:\n- Photographs showing open burning\n- Video evidence of poorly managed operations\n- Written testimony documenting burning of treated wooden pallets and melamine-coated particle board\n- Evidence of unrestricted public access from residential street where children play\n\n\nI explicitly noted the site appeared to be \"effectively an open fire\" with serious fire risk implications.\n\n\n**September 2022**: No response. I requested acknowledgement.\n\n\n**October 2022**: Council response arrived. The Environmental Protection Manager explained:\n\n\n> \"Council's odour assessments, between Sep 2021 and June 2022, have not identified or witnessed presence of statutory nuisance at the complainants' addresses.\n\n\n\"The council had conducted almost a **year-long daily investigation** in response to complaints (though they'd previously stated there were \"no complaints\"). Despite this year-long effort, investigating officers were \"unable to verify any odour nuisance, or enforce better practices.\"\n\n\nThe council would, however, write to businesses requesting they explore \"additional best practicable means\" to reduce emissions.\n\n\n**November 2022**: I requested a copy of this letter. No response.\n\n\n**February 2023**: Three months later, still no response. I visited the site again and reported the incinerator at Sam's Recycling appeared to have been enclosed with corrugated sheets - possibly removed or being replaced.\n\n\n**March 2023**: Council responded with links to Environment Agency permit registrations for the sites. However, as I noted, these permits didn't mention waste incineration or incinerator use.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/20260115-234203-collage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Text on a tilted paper mentions a complaint about Sam's Recycling and an incinerator, with references to the EA and a code WEX300101.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\n**August 2023**: After nearly 18 months of correspondence, I summarised my understanding in a detailed email. Point 15 stated:\n\n\n> \"It seems to me that your investigative techniques, however improved you claim them to be, aren't actually any good at all, and **perhaps are designed to be that way**. After all, if you could 'verify' what I and other residents tell you, then you might have to take enforcement action.\"\n\n\n**September 2023**: No response. I requested acknowledgement.\n\n\n**January 2024**: I escalated to formal complaint, noting it had been over four months since my August email with no acknowledgement, \"let alone any response.\"\n\n\nAccording to the council's complaints policy, I should have received acknowledgement within four days and a Stage One response within twenty days.\n\n\n**January 2024**: Three weeks later, still no acknowledgement. I noted the breach of complaints policy.\"\n\n\n**January 2026**: A devastating fire guts the site causing over half a million pounds worth of damages according to the owner when I spoke to him.\n\n\n# The Investigation That Found Nothing\n\n\nSo what happened during that almost year-long \"daily investigation\" between September 2021 and June 2022?\n\n\nAccording to the council:\n- No evidence of statutory odour nuisance was identified\n- Officers were unable to verify any odour nuisance\n- Officers were unable to enforce better practices\n- Initial indications suggested odour intensity and chemical concentrations were \"well below national and international standards\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, in just two or three visits made in response to strong burning plastic odours entering my home, I documented:\n- Open or poorly enclosed incineration\n- Burning of treated wood, melamine, and plastic waste\n- Smoke plumes affecting residential areas\n- Unsafe waste handling and storage\n- Explicit fire risk from poor management\n- Unrestricted public access where children play\n\n\n# The Methodology Gap\n\n\nHow is it possible for a year-long daily investigation by trained professionals to find no evidence of problems that a resident documented in three visits?\n\n\n**Three possibilities:**\n\n\n1. **I fabricated evidence.** \n\n\nThe photographs and video are fake. My written testimony is false. The burning plastic odours I and my neighbours experienced were imagined.\n\n\n2. **Council investigators are incompetent.** \n\n\nDespite being trained Environmental Health Officers, despite having dedicated resources, despite a year of daily monitoring, they genuinely couldn't detect what untrained residents could document in hours.\n\n\n3. **Investigation techniques are designed not to verify harm.** \n\n\nAs I suggested in my August 2023 email: if investigators could verify what residents report, they would have to take enforcement action. Better to conduct investigations in ways that consistently fail to establish statutory nuisance thresholds.\n\n\nI don't believe I fabricated evidence. My photographs exist. The fire occurred exactly as the evidence suggested it would.\n\n\nI don't believe council investigators are universally incompetent. Some may be excellent at their jobs.\n\n\n**That leaves the third option.**\n\n\n# What \"Investigation\" Actually Means\n\n\nThe year-long investigation wasn't designed to establish whether harmful practices were occurring. It was designed to establish whether those practices met the specific legal threshold of \"statutory nuisance\" sufficient to trigger enforcement action.\n\n\nThese are not the same thing.\n\n\nHarmful practices can continue indefinitely without meeting statutory nuisance thresholds, particularly when:\n- Investigation methodologies require direct witnessing at specific moments\n- Odour assessments depend on subjective officer judgment at time of visit\n- Chemical monitoring is time-limited and may miss peak exposures\n- Regulatory frameworks create jurisdictional confusion\n- \"Best practice\" letters substitute for enforcement action\n- Complaints are acknowledged but not acted upon\n\n\nThe result is a system that generates impressive paperwork - year-long investigations! Daily monitoring! Coordination between departments! - while ensuring harmful activities continue until catastrophic failure forces intervention.\n\n\n# The Pattern Across Southall\n\n\nThis isn't unique to Johnson Street. It's the same pattern documented across multiple pollution cases in Southall:\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/20260115-234838-collage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Text snippets highlight concerns about air quality reports and legal limits for pollutants.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\n**FM Conway**: Dr John Freeman, council's former air quality officer, admitted at a September 2018 Air Quality Scrutiny Panel meeting there had been a \"[lack of scrutiny](https://southallstories.uk/2019/08/25/southall-under-siege-the-neighbours/)\" of this operator. Despite \"a considerable body of complaints,\" enforcement remained elusive.\n\n\n**Southall Gasworks**: Between 2017-2020, residents reported severe respiratory symptoms, hospitalisations, and toxic odours. Public Health England eventually acknowledged naphthalene levels required \"urgent reduction\" - but only after I pointed out at a public meeting that localised readings were consistently above legal limits, contrary to the \"site averages\" PHE had presented suggesting no harm.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/screenshot-20260120-133809.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"282\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Public Health England's report states that current naphthalene levels aren't immediately risky but should be reduced to prevent long-term exposure.\">\n\n\n--- My son was hospitalised three times with asthma in 2016-2017 when gasworks remediation began. The headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School reported to governors that \"[very strong smells from the gasworks site caused asthma and headaches](https://southallstories.uk/2018/09/11/berkeleys-school-governors-board-member/).\"\n\n\nPHE's final position: no physical harm occurred, though they acknowledged some residents experienced anxiety about exposure (implying psychological rather than toxicological harm). This despite later admitting naphthalene levels exceeded safety thresholds when examined at neighbourhood level rather than site-wide averages.\n\n\n**Johnson Street**: Year-long investigation finding no evidence of problems. Site continues operating. Fire occurs exactly as residents predicted.\n\n\n# The Class and Race Context\n\n\nIn my formal complaint, I drew comparison with Council Leader Peter Mason's response to different pollution incidents:\n\n\n> \"My reason for sharing Peter Mason's breathless twittering about the poisoning of the Brent River was not for you [...] to do anything about it, but simply to highlight the disparity between how people in Southall are treated when we complain about poison air from Mason's MIPIM party sponsors, and how eels are treated by our new council leader and Southall Green ward councillor.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/20260120-134846.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"532\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Twitter exchange criticizes Thames Water for dumping sewage into the River Brent, calling for enforcement action from the Environment Agency.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\nWhen eels in the River Brent faced toxic exposure, Mason tweeted demanding immediate enforcement action against \"disgusting and depressing\" pollution.\n\n\nWhen predominantly Black and Asian residents of Southall reported toxic air exposure, hospitalised children, and explicit fire risks, the same council leader consistently stated [no enforcement action can be taken](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18503/open_letter_to_cash_from_cllr_peter_mason_leader_of_ealing_council_november_2022.pdf).\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/20260120-134910.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"955\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet thread by Peter Mason discusses a meeting about air quality and pollution, highlighting the importance of accountability and the ongoing need for change.\">\n\n\n--- \n\n\nThis isn't accidental.

Everyone, particularly those who are vulnerable, should be able to expect to have their complaint taken seriously.\"\n\n\nGove noted this indicated \"wider organisational culture at the council.\"\n\n\nThe Johnson Street fire - occurring 30 months after explicit written warnings, photographic evidence, and formal complaints that went unacknowledged - proves he was right about that culture.\n\n\n# Why \"Best Practice\" Letters Don't Work\n\n\nThe council's response to resident concerns was to write to businesses requesting they \"explore what additional best practicable means could be taken to reduce potential impact.\"\n\n\nBut as the council itself acknowledged: **\"This can only be a request from the Council.

And then they determined that no action was required.**\n\n\nThe better question is: **Why do investigation methodologies consistently fail to verify harm that residents can document, predict, and experience - until catastrophic failure proves residents were right all along?**\n\n\nThat question exposes something more troubling than neglect.\n\n\nIt exposes systems designed to manage complaints rather than address harm.\n\n\nIt exposes regulatory frameworks that prioritise operational continuity over precautionary protection.\n\n\nIt exposes methodologies that require perfect evidence at the perfect moment, while rejecting pattern evidence from residents whose daily lives give them vastly more observation time than occasional site visits.\n\n\nIt exposes jurisdictional confusion that functions as liability shield, with each authority claiming another holds responsibility until harm escalates beyond deniability.\n\n\n# The Accountability Gap\n\nThe fire occurred exactly as residents predicted in explicit written warnings submitted 30 months prior, accompanied by photographic evidence, video documentation, and formal complaints.The council conducted a year-long investigation and found no evidence requiring enforcement action.\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/20260115-235211-collage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A collage of document snippets features partial text about failed complaints and a poisoning investigation.\">\n\n--- \n\nOne of these accounts is accurate. Both cannot be.\n\nEither residents fabricated evidence of problems that didn't exist, or investigation methodologies are designed to avoid verifying harm that does exist.\n\nThe fire proves which account is accurate.\n\n# What This Means\n\nThe Johnson Street fire should not be investigated as an isolated incident of unknown cause. It should be investigated as the predictable endpoint of regulatory culture that prioritises paperwork over precaution.\n\nThe investigation should examine:\n1. **Why year-long daily monitoring failed to verify harm residents documented in three visits**\n2. **Why photographic and video evidence was insufficient to trigger enforcement action**\n3. **Why explicit fire risk warnings in formal complaints went unacknowledged**\n4. **Why \"best practice\" letters with no enforcement mechanism substitute for operational suspension when evidence warrants**\n5. **Why jurisdictional confusion between council and Environment Agency persists across multiple cases**\n6. **Why complaint policy breaches occurred when formal escalation was attempted**\n7. **Whether investigation methodologies are designed to verify harm or to avoid triggering enforcement thresholds**\n\nAny investigation that treats this fire as unforeseeable - when residents literally foresaw it and documented the prediction - will miss the essential truth.\n\n**This fire happened not despite investigation, but because of how investigation operates when applied to communities whose warnings are systematically discounted.**\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/20260115-234021-collage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A partially visible email discusses waste incinerators and regulators, involving the Environment Agency.\">\n\n--- \n\nThe council checked it out. They spent a year checking it out. That's what makes this worse.\n\nBecause it means the fire occurred not through ignorance, but through choice: the choice to conduct investigations in ways that consistently fail to verify harm, to accept jurisdictional confusion as operational framework, to substitute \"best practice\" letters for enforcement action, and to leave formal complaints unacknowledged until catastrophic failure forces temporary intervention.\n\nThey checked it out. They found nothing. And then exactly what residents warned about came true.\n\nThat's not regulatory failure. **That's regulatory function.**\n\n---\n\n**The full correspondence documenting this timeline is available through Freedom of Information requests to Ealing Council. Residents deserve to see what \"year-long daily investigation\" actually produces when applied to explicit warnings that later prove accurate.**\n",

Concrete frames do not reduce waiting lists. \n\n\n\n\nCounting holes in the ground as “available homes delivered” is performative theatre, playground pretend politics not grown-up housing policy.\n\n\n\n\nThis accounting trick allows failure to be repackaged and sold to the electorate as success - while families remain stuck in overcrowded, inappropriate and expensive temporary accommodation.\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/screenshot-20260116-202438.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"960\" alt=\"A Twitter post by Peter Mason showcases a modern housing development at Norwood Road in Southall Green aimed at providing genuinely affordable homes, with an image of the homes and a retweet of Ealing Council's announcement about their construction.\">  \n\n\n\n\n--- \n  \n# The Southall Housing Disaster\n\n\n\n\nFour years ago, Mason had ascended the greasy leadership pole (metaphorically stomping on his predecessor and mentor Julian Bell's head [on the way up](https://ealingmatters.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210901-EM-newsletter-11-final.pdf)) and found himself perched precariously at its summit. \n\n\n\n\nGiddy with power, perhaps, and desperate to retain it just before the upcoming local elections, Peter proclaimed that he had built some beautiful and very much needed family homes in chronically overcrowded Southall Green, the ward he is elected to represent.  \n  \n>As is common with Peter Mason (and emperors with new wardrobes), all is often not as it seems. \n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/pxl-20260117-1351162372.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"451\" alt=\"A construction site billboard is overgrown with weeds and displays information about an affordable family housing project in Norwood Road, Southall, set for completion in 2023.\">\n\n\n\n\n--- \n  \nUnfortunately for Peter, and for the families desperate for a proper home of their own, the builders Peter hired went bust before completion. For three years we've been left with this half-built eyesore rotting in the rain.   \n  \n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/pxl-20260117-135153885.mp2.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"451\" alt=\"Inside the Norwood Road construction site, Southall, with partially built purple brick structures, surrounded by scattered debris and construction materials.\">\n\n\n\n\n--- \n\n\n\n\nWhat makes this so much worse, is that Henry Construction's owners had [form](https://open.substack.com/pub/theviewfromw5/p/demolition-of-ealing-homes-part-of-trail-chaos).

Instead, we got Peter Mason.\n\n\n\n\n# What Happens Next?\n\n\n\n\nNorwood Road will likely be demolished. Millions more will be spent rebuilding what should never have failed. Waiting-list families will continue waiting. [The housing crisis in Ealing](https://southallstories.uk/2022/12/17/the-property-lobby-the-hidden/) will deepen.\n\n\n\n\nWhy should Southall Green voters trust Mason to deliver housing when his track record demonstrates the opposite?\n\n\n\n\nThe Norwood Road site isn't unique - it's symptomatic. Across Ealing, the same patterns repeat: grand announcements, botched delivery, zero accountability, and working-class communities left picking up the pieces. \n\n\n\n\n>This is governance by press release, and it's time someone demanded better.\n",

I'm not aware of any children being born with birth defects, but I know there were lots of [reports of health problems](https://southallstories.uk/2019/06/25/the-health-and-other-impacts/) including: \n- eye, nose and throat irritation\n- nausea and vomiting\n- chest infections and breathing difficulties \n- heart problems \n- cancer\n- ectopic pregnancy\n- non-epileptic seizures\n- sudden death of previously healthy pets\n\nI know that some people reported worsening of asthma and other health conditions. \n\nThese are all consistent with exposure to [benzene](https://southallstories.uk/2018/08/03/health-risks-of-exposure-to/), [naphthalene](https://southallstories.uk/2019/07/12/naphthalene-poisoning-risk-in-people/) and other [volatile organic compounds](https://southallstories.uk/2023/05/01/risks-to-health-from-remediating/) known to be buried at the gasworks site.\n\n\nDespite resistance from [Berkeley Group](https://southallstories.uk/categories/berkeley-group/) and [Ealing Labour](https://southallstories.uk/categories/ealing-labour/) Council, we eventually managed to get the [air quality data](https://southallstories.uk/2018/11/02/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics/). \n\nThe problem was that it arrived as thousands of pages of scanned PDFs, making meaningful analysis almost impossible.\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2026/screenshot-20251121-195851.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"443\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A table details gas analysis results with various chemical components listed along with their measured values across multiple sample locations.\">\n\n---\n\n\nLast year, I tried using AI to process the material. Even then, it couldn’t reliably read it.\n\nRecently, I tried again using a different technique - and this time it worked.\n\nWhat’s emerging is striking: high levels of benzene and naphthalene closely match the dates and times when people reported odours and health effects, both publicly (on social media) and privately (by email or message). I kept all the records.\n\nI’m now working through around 1,300 pages of data, alongside every report of odours or illness I can trace, to match them up fully. In truth, many of us always suspected or knew in our hearts - and lungs - this connection - but for years we were told by authorities that:\n- it was [all in our heads](https://southallstories.uk/2019/07/09/phe-coverup/) \n- the air was [safe and the odours harmless to health](https://southallstories.uk/2019/07/21/phe-coverup-continued/) despite levels being over legal limits.<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/img-20211030-184939.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"224\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A bar chart compares the levels of various toxic hydrocarbons emitted from Southall Old Gasworks Soil Hospital across different time periods, indicating whether they exceed legal limits.\">\n\n--- \n\nI’m writing this now for two reasons.\n\nFirst, to reconnect with some of you I lost touch with over the past five years - life happened, including a second child arriving right at the start of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, to ask how things are now.\n- Has anything changed?\n- Is it still happening?\n- How’s your health?\n\nFor me personally, I was diagnosed with [chronic lung disease](https://southallstories.uk/2024/10/31/copd/) last year. I honestly don’t know whether it’s related - but I can’t help wondering. I sincerely hope it’s just me, and that everyone else is healthy and well.\n\nEither way, I’d really like to hear from you - whether you’ve been quiet for years, or are reading this for the first time. This isn't about blame or legal action, although that could change. At this stage, it's simply about gathering all the available evidence and people's stories, for the record. \n\nYou can respond:\n- in the comments below\n- by [email](mailto:david@davidmarsden.info): david@davidmarsden.info\n- via [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/qr/4MUTFBX64DCIB1): https://wa.me/qr/4MUTFBX64DCIB1\n\n\nIf you’d rather not revisit this period, I completely understand.\n\n\nAll private conversations are confidential unless you explicitly consent to attribution.\n",

Mason has been refining this argument for a decade, and the 2023 strategy represents its ultimate expression: 760+ assets under \"review\" while claiming to prioritise community needs.\n\n\n## **The MIPIM Pipeline: From Bell to Mason**\n\n\nThe systematic disposal becomes more sinister when connected to the [£33,000+ in \"gifts\"](https://southallstories.uk/2022/12/17/the-property-lobby-the-hidden/) and MIPIM conference attendance that Mason and his predecessor Julian Bell accepted from developers, including Berkeley Group. \n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/img-20211110-wa0008.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"693\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two men are discussing a detailed architectural model with a backdrop showcasing Ealing's development plans.\">\n---\n\nThe visual evidence tells the story perfectly. At property conferences, Mason sits listening intently as Bell explains developer's \"long-term vision\" - not for residents, but for profitable disposal. \n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/screenshot-20210522-203508.png\" width=\"237\" height=\"254\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two men are sitting at a table with drinks and holding a framed picture between them.\">\n---\n\nElsewhere, Mason and Bell enjoy a pint together down the local pub, the mentor passing on his expertise to the protégé. At MIPIM-style events, they share champagne and development plans with property interests. \n\n\nWhen Berkeley Group literally sponsors council events with \"PROUDLY SPONSORED BY Berkeley\" branding, the capture becomes complete.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/pmtq12.jpg\" width=\"410\" height=\"178\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A sponsorship wall displays logos of various companies, including British Land and Berkeley, with the prominent text Ealing London on the left.\">\n---\n\nWhen your town planner council leader and his mentor [take developer hospitality](https://southallstories.uk/2022/12/17/the-property-lobby-the-hidden/) while disposing of community assets, the conflicts of interest become embedded in the planning system itself.\n\n\n## **Democracy 2.0: Now With Less Democracy**\n\n\nThe system's crowning achievement is happening right now. In July 2025, Ealing Council [rewrote petition rules](https://southallstories.uk/2025/07/16/the-pied-piper-of-ealing/) in direct response to successful community campaigns, removing residents' rights to ask follow-up questions and requirements for senior officers to give evidence.\n\n\nThey've solved the democracy problem by removing the democratic bits from democracy. It's the perfect complement to an asset disposal programme that operates through consultation theatre - predetermined outcomes with participation facades.\n\n\n## **The Bigger Picture**\n\n\nWhat Ealing's 18-year asset disposal programme reveals isn't just local government corruption - it's the systematic implementation of neoliberal ideology through administrative process. The Dominion Centre model of 2007 has become the \"community hub\" euphemism of 2023, turning public assets into \"underutilised resources\" requiring \"optimisation.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/img-20220216-wa0005.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"346\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two people in safety gear are enjoying a snack of popcorn at a construction site.\">\n\n---\nThe 2011 developers' wish-list has become official council strategy. The governance failures Eric Leach exposed around Victoria Hall operate across every aspect of the programme. Mason's 70.9% pay rise and the £1m+ cost of his and councillor allowances increases while closing half of Ealing's Children's Centres to save a few hundred thousand pounds shows exactly whose side Ealing Labour are on. And it isn't ours!\n\n\nIt's Thatcherism with a human face - and that face belongs to Peter Mason, the New Labour politician who learned to speak her language fluently while pretending to oppose her legacy.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/img-20211223-wa0006.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"363\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person with a microphone stands outdoors next to a decorated tree, wearing a coat and scarf, with the text I'm sorry that visible.\">---\n\n\nThe Victoria Hall campaign continues. The legal challenge proceeds. The 760+ assets remain under \"strategic review.\" And the machinery of systematic disposal, finally revealed in the 2023 strategy document, operates in plain sight - hidden only by the euphemistic language that transforms asset stripping into community empowerment.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Key Documents:**\n- [Ealing Council 2023-2027 Land and Property Strategy](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18971/land_and_property_strategy.pdf)\n- [2011 \"Monopoly meeting\" exposé](https://southallstories.uk/2022/03/25/ealing-monopoly/)\n- [Victoria Hall legal challenge](https://savethevictoriahall.weebly.com/)\n- [July 2025 petition rule changes](https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g6611/Public%20reports%20pack%20Tuesday%2015-Jul-2025%2019.00%20Council.pdf?T=10)\n\n\n*Follow this story and more with a free subscription: [southallstories.uk](https://southallstories.uk/subscribe/)*\n",

Nothing to see here!</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get even more interesting. The Council&rsquo;s own &ldquo;<a href=\"https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s1726/Southall%20Reset.pdf\">Southall Reset</a>&rdquo; [pdf] document acknowledges that &ldquo;challenges of deprivation, low pay, are particularly acute&rdquo; in Southall, contributing to &ldquo;deeply embedded health and wellbeing challenges.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Race Equality Commission Report &ldquo;highlighted the need for an investment in adequate primary care in Southall&rdquo; and &ldquo;deeper meaningful engagement, and better conversations with residents.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Council&rsquo;s response to this need for MORE investment? Close children&rsquo;s centres.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So you know we need MORE investment?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. The evidence is clear,&rdquo; they said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Then why are you closing children&rsquo;s centres?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Budget pressures.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But your own report says we need more investment, not less.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different report.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your report.

They could officially acknowledge that Southall needed more investment while simultaneously cutting investment. They could document the problem and implement policies that made it worse. Each document existed in its own logical universe, disconnected from actual decisions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-6-the-mipim-negotiations\">Chapter 6: The MIPIM Negotiations</h2>\n<p>Every year, the Council Leader attends MIPIM in Cannes - what Private Eye calls a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://stopthetowers.info/the-mipim-jolly\">booze &lsquo;n&rsquo; hookerfest</a>&rdquo; - with expenses paid by Berkeley Group, the company behind the gasworks development that&rsquo;s been poisoning Southall residents.</p>\n<p>He goes to &ldquo;negotiate hard&rdquo; with developers.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The documented results of these negotiations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More developments approved</li>\n<li>Continued toxic air from gasworks</li>\n<li>Larger councillor allowances</li>\n<li>Closure of community facilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Either he&rsquo;s a remarkably poor negotiator, or &ldquo;negotiating hard&rdquo; means something different in Cannes than it does in English.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-7-the-zionist-anti-zionist-synthesis\">Chapter 7: The Zionist-Anti-Zionist Synthesis</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader represents Southall Green - 69% BAME, one of the most ethnically diverse wards in Britain. Many of his constituents have strong views about Palestinian liberation.</p>\n<p>His attitude? &ldquo;People who commit themselves to being opposed to Jewish national self determination / liberation aren&rsquo;t my cup of tea. They can exist, sure, just outside of the Labour movement.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So he simultaneously represents a diverse community while working to exclude people from that community based on their views about Middle Eastern politics.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a masterclass in representation: represent everyone, except the people whose politics you disagree with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-8-the-protection-by-destruction-innovation\">Chapter 8: The Protection-by-Destruction Innovation</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader has pioneered a new approach to public service: protecting things by eliminating them.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Govt Commissioners to slash and burn services,&rdquo; he explains, while slashing and burning services.</p>\n<p>It was like watching someone slash the low-hanging fruit on the trees and then set fire to the orchard; then selling the &ldquo;infertile land&rdquo; to developers when there&rsquo;s nothing to eat.</p>\n<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t even the worst part. Mrs. Patel had discovered something even more troubling. Back in 2012, a group of unelected businessmen had met to play <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W2HRPD00OiidxP9iAlLPDFHPVwZcEfeM/view?usp=drivesdk\">Monopoly</a> [pdf] with public assets. Not the board game - though the principle was identical. They wanted to &ldquo;sell off our public assets for £20m profit.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Their target included &ldquo;buildings used for services for vulnerable adults, children and families.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So they planned this years ago?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked the councillor.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about that,&rdquo; the councillor said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re closing children&rsquo;s centres,&rdquo; Mrs. Patel said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting services by cutting them,&rdquo; they explained patiently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Government Commissioners to slash and burn services.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But you ARE slashing and burning services.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting them by cutting them responsibly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How is closing them protecting them?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t close them, someone else will close them worse.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ldquo;The Government Commissioners.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Have they said they&rsquo;ll close them?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re closing them to prevent them being closed?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting them by cutting them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Round and round she went, trapped in a perfectly logical system designed to make resistance impossible.</p>\n<p>The beautiful thing was that everyone was telling the truth. The councillor really didn&rsquo;t know about the 2012 meeting. The 2012 meeting really had happened. The plan really was being implemented. Nobody was really in charge of implementing it.</p>\n<p>Somehow, a decision made by people who didn&rsquo;t officially exist was being executed by people who officially couldn&rsquo;t stop it.\nThis allows him to be simultaneously the protector of services and the person closing services - a remarkable administrative innovation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-9-democracy-20---now-with-less-democracy\">Chapter 9: Democracy 2.0 - Now With Less Democracy</h2>\n<p>But the system&rsquo;s crowning achievement is happening right now. <strong>This month - July 2025 - Ealing Council is rewriting the petition rules</strong> in direct response to successful community campaigns.</p>\n<p>On page 294 of their July 15, 2025 council <a href=\"https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g6611/Public%20reports%20pack%20Tuesday%2015-Jul-2025%2019.00%20Council.pdf?T=10\">papers</a> [pdf, see p. 294], you can see democracy being crossed out in real time. They&rsquo;re removing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Residents' rights to ask follow-up questions</li>\n<li>Requirements for senior officers to give evidence</li>\n<li>Meaningful participation in debates about their own petitions</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>They&rsquo;ve solved the democracy problem by removing the democratic bits from democracy.</p>\n<p>The timing is perfect: after communities proved they could win by building independent pressure (Save Southall Young Adult Centre, Save Southall Town Hall, Save Warren Farm Nature Reserve), the council is changing the rules to prevent it happening again.</p>\n<p>Soon residents will be able to petition - they just won&rsquo;t be able to ask questions, get answers, or participate in discussions about their concerns.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s democracy in name only, which is much more efficient than the old democracy where people could actually influence things.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-10-the-southall-young-adult-centre-miracle\">Chapter 10: The Southall Young Adult Centre Miracle</h2>\n<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing - resistance is still possible. In 2022, the Council wanted to demolish Southall Young Adult Centre to build 60 flats. The usual process commenced: consultation theater, predetermined decisions, official helplessness.</p>\n<p>Then the &ldquo;Save Southall Young Adult Centre&rdquo; campaign launched. They didn&rsquo;t try to work within the impossible system. They built independent pressure. They refused to accept that &ldquo;decisions had been made.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>They <a href=\"https://www.visitsouthall.co.uk/News/NewsDetails.php?recordID=1235\">won</a>.</p>\n<p>The centre was saved.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We stopped playing by their rules,&rdquo; the organisers said. &ldquo;We built power they couldn&rsquo;t ignore.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-11-the-impossible-solution\">Chapter 11: The Impossible Solution</h2>\n<p>Mrs. Patel realized the children&rsquo;s centres could be saved the same way. But it would require doing something the system said was impossible: organising outside the official channels, building independent power, refusing to accept predetermined outcomes.</p>\n<p>The Council had just changed the petition rules specifically to prevent another people-powered victory. But that only proved they were afraid of effective organising.</p>\n<p>The system&rsquo;s weakness was its strength: it was so obviously absurd that anyone paying attention could see through it.</p>\n<p>The Council Leader could tweet about putting &ldquo;people before buildings&rdquo; while closing buildings where people accessed services. He could claim to protect services while cutting them. He could represent diverse communities while excluding their political views. He could prioritize eels over children and call it environmentalism.</p>\n<p>All of this was only possible because residents had been playing by rules designed to make them lose.</p>\n<p>But the campaigns to save the Young Adult Centre, the Town Hall and Warren Farm proved the rules could be broken.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-12-the-choice\">Chapter 12: The Choice</h2>\n<p>Mrs. Patel had a choice. She could continue navigating the impossible bureaucracy, filing petitions that couldn&rsquo;t ask questions, attending consultations about predetermined decisions, lobbying councillors who claimed to have no power.</p>\n<p>Or she could do what the other campaigners did: build independent power and refuse to accept defeat.</p>\n<p>The children&rsquo;s centres could be saved. But only if parents stopped trying to reason with an unreasonable system and started building the power to change it.</p>\n<p>The Council Leader would continue inhabiting his world of simultaneous contradictions, where closing centres meant protecting them and cutting services meant investing in communities.</p>\n<p>But Mrs. Patel had learned something important: impossible things happen every day in Ealing politics.</p>\n<p>If the Council Leader could be simultaneously progressive and regressive, protective and destructive, representative and exclusionary, then maybe Mrs. Patel could do something equally impossible.</p>\n<p>Like save a children&rsquo;s centre.</p>\n<p>The Young Adult Centre campaigners had already shown it could be done.</p>\n<p>Now it was the children&rsquo;s centres' turn.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Even this right wing authoritarian Labour government thinks it&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvj1jr0kz0o\">bad idea</a> to close children&rsquo;s centres.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-13-the-engagement-paradox\">Chapter 13: The Engagement Paradox</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader had perfected the art of simultaneous engagement.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>He could tweet about &ldquo;absolutely committed to engaging, listening and compromising&rdquo; while sharing photos of residents protesting his refusal to engage, listen, or compromise.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>He spoke frequently about &ldquo;transparent engagement&rdquo; and &ldquo;finding the compromises everyone needs to make&rdquo; - usually while explaining why the compromises residents needed to make were accepting whatever he&rsquo;d already decided.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Even councillors who were &ldquo;most responsive&rdquo; resigned rather than &ldquo;effectively endorse his toxic brand of politics.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But the real innovation was tweeting &ldquo;Welcome to Dystopia&rdquo; while creating it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"chapter-14-the-investment-paradox\">Chapter 14: The Investment Paradox</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader had achieved something remarkable: he could simultaneously remember genocide while investing in it. &ldquo;Remember Yesterday, Act Today,&rdquo; his council posted about the genocide of 8,732 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica thirty years ago, while <a href=\"https://lgpsdivest.org/lgps-investments/\">investing £112 million</a> in companies enabling genocide of <a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/news/2025/05/un-women-estimates-over-28000-women-and-girls-killed-in-gaza-since-october-2023\">more than 28,000 women and girls</a> in Gaza today. <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unimaginable-horrors-more-50000-children-reportedly-killed-or-injured-gaza-strip\">More than 50,000 children killed or injured</a> in Gaza to pay for his pension.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It was beautifully efficient. Why limit yourself to one genocide when you could remember one while funding another? The children understood perfectly.</p>\n<p>Equally impressive was his ability to close children&rsquo;s centres for budget reasons while sitting on the board as a <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/opdc_2020.21_audited_annual_report_and_accounts.pdf\">paid director</a> [pdf] of a corporation that had just received £140 million in public funding. The logic was flawless: children&rsquo;s services were unaffordable, but corporate development was essential.</p>\n<p>The Council Leader had mastered the art of proportional response. Children&rsquo;s centres closing to save £750,000? Budget pressures, difficult decisions, no choice. Sitting on the board overseeing &ldquo;one of the biggest regeneration schemes in Europe&rdquo; with £140 million in funding? That was worth £2,000 a year of his valuable time.</p>\n<p>It was a masterclass in priorities: Europe&rsquo;s biggest regeneration project required his oversight, but Southall&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s centres were an unaffordable luxury.</p>\n<p>He could simultaneously claim there was no money for community services while helping to plan a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/fresh-pictures-reveal-what-london-22320564\">mini-Manhattan</a>&rdquo; in his own borough. The vision was clear: 54-storey towers, yes. Children&rsquo;s centres, no.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;d found the perfect balance: cut services locally to save money, earn money regionally to oversee developers' profits. It was like a perpetual motion machine of fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-and-verse-the-evolution-of-enlightenment\">Chapter and Verse: The Evolution of Enlightenment</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In 2010, our future Council Leader shared his frustration about &ldquo;sitting around not understanding all this punjabi&rdquo; at community meetings in the area he would later represent.</p>\n<p>By 2020, he had evolved. &ldquo;Words have consequences,&rdquo; he tweeted. &ldquo;Impact is as important as intent. Culture is defined by leadership.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Ten years of personal growth had taught him that words matter. Which made it remarkable that he could simultaneously lecture about cultural sensitivity while closing community centres in the same diverse communities he&rsquo;d once struggled to understand. It was a masterclass in progressive evolution: you could acknowledge that words have consequences while ensuring your own words from the past had none.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>Readers who think this is all a bit unfair, unbelievable, unhelpful or downright unlawful&hellip;</p>\n<p>The most revealing evidence of how the system works came from inside the machine itself. In 2022, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hZfSB-RR7OzeCIHclKdiJd_FTnUtT7KA/view?usp=drivesdk\">leaked WhatsApp messages</a> [pdf] from the Ealing Labour councillors' group chat revealed what they really thought about their leadership.</p>\n<p>Mason&rsquo;s own Labour colleagues called the Council Leader &ldquo;callous, ruthless, sectarian.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>They discussed votes of no confidence, referenced &ldquo;corruption and even theft&rdquo; regarding the previous leader, and debated &ldquo;bribes&rdquo; and &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; for loyalty. Meanwhile, publicly, they maintained perfect unity and collective responsibility. It was the perfect illustration of how the system works: private recognition of the problems, public performance of harmony.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel understood perfectly. The same councillors who privately criticised authoritarian leadership accepted Mason&rsquo;s cabinet positions and pay rises to sit in silent support during council meetings.The leaked messages proved Mrs. Patel wasn&rsquo;t imagining the contradictions - even the people inside the system could see them.

On January 15, 2015, he tweeted: *\"Think its really important that we put people before buildings. Important we keep activities going & that can be done in a different way.\"*\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/fc83f238fa.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason emphasizes prioritizing people over buildings and discusses Ealing Council's community centers at a committee meeting.\">\n\n\nTen years later, he's [closing children's centres](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xv1ylplzzo), buildings where people access those activities.\n\n\nThis isn't hypocrisy - it's innovation. Why limit yourself to consistent principles when you can have all the principles, simultaneously?\n\n\nMrs. Patel, a parent trying to save her local children's centre, discovered this when she attempted to navigate Ealing's democratic processes. What she found was a system so logically perfect that resistance had become mathematically impossible.\n\n\n## Chapter 2: The Democratic Möbius Strip\n\n\n\"Who decides about children's centre closures?\" Mrs. Patel asked at a council meeting.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/98e8dd79de.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two men are discussing next to an illuminated architectural model, with a display board about Ealing's short-term vision in the background.\">\n\n\n\"The Cabinet,\" she was told.\n\n\nThe Cabinet explained they were implementing officer recommendations based on budget pressures created by government policy following community consultation showing residents wanted services maintained differently.\n\n\n\"So who can change the decision?\"\n\n\n\"The decision-makers.\"\n\n\n\"Who are the decision-makers?\"\n\n\n\"The people with authority to make decisions.\"\n\n\n\"Who has that authority?\"\n\n\n\"The decision-makers.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel found herself trapped in a perfectly circular system. To influence the decision, she needed to identify who made it. But everyone who appeared to make decisions claimed to be implementing someone else's decisions. The decision seemed to exist independently of anyone actually deciding anything.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/0be5b8f75d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Möbius strip, shown with a twist and a small person observing, illustrates its unique one-sided property.\">\nImage: Jono Hey, [Sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/mobius-strip)\n\n\nIt was like a democratic Möbius strip - no matter which direction you followed, you always ended up back where you started.\n\n\n## Chapter 3: The Mathematics of Progressive Budget Management\n\n\nThe numbers, at least, were clear:\n\n\n- **Cost of councillor allowance increases (2022-2025):** Over £1 million\n- **[Savings](https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/3-ealing-childrens-centres-saved-31844687) from closing children's centres:** £750,000\n- **Council Leader's [pay rise](https://ealing.news/ealing-council/ealing-council-leader-peter-mason-massive-allowance-rise-by-over-70-along-with-increases-for-his-cabinet/):** 70%\n- **Number of children's centres being closed in Southall:** 3 out of 6\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7bb908e3f4.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"778\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A group of people are holding signs in a protest, with one reading KIDS OUT! Someone has to pay for my 70% pay rise and another reading NO MORE PLAY SCHOOL!.\">\n\n\nThe Council Leader had discovered something revolutionary: you could simultaneously claim budget constraints while voting yourself substantial pay rises. The secret was treating these as completely unrelated mathematical operations.\n\n\n\"We have to make difficult decisions due to budget pressures,\" he explained, while awarding himself £58,000 annually.\n\n\n\"But you spent more on pay rises than you're saving,\" Mrs. Patel pointed out.\n\n\n\"That's a different budget.\"\n\n\n\"It's the same money.\"\n\n\n\"You don't understand local government finance. And we need [higher calibre](https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&spage=common/eacouncil220.htm) councillor candidates.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly.\n\n\n## Chapter 4: Environmental Priorities - A Scientific Approach\n\n\nThe Council Leader's environmental consciousness follows a precise hierarchy, documented through his public responses:\n\n\n**Tier 1 Emergency Response:** Eels gasping in the River Brent receive [immediate action](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18312/to_thames_water_-_sewage_entering_into_the_river_brent.pdf) [pdf) and public concern.\n\n\n**Tier 2 Public Complaint:** Someone's \"bag and/or small child\" taking up a tube seat merits a public tweet about \"Some people.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/c0020bb277.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"253\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Peter Mason tweets about taking the tube instead of cycling and needing someone to move their bag or child for him to sit.\">\n\n\n**Tier 3 Busy Schedule:** [Children gasping from toxic air](https://youtu.be/xA4mI_OAzxs) [YouTube] in bedrooms get told \" [I'm very busy.](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxCUBKF53mk-J0KrZ4bxXaoAxc9iVEQhN-)\" [YouTube)]\n\n\nWhen five-year-old Zion asked him directly, \"[Peter, why didn't you help us?](https://youtu.be/w-p6qy2RfR8)\" [YouTube] about the gasworks poisoning, the response was so technical that Zion said it was \"too sciencey\" to understand.\n\n\nThis established a clear principle: if environmental concerns can't be explained to five-year-olds, they're probably too complex for five-year-olds to experience.\n\n\n## Chapter 5: The Southall Paradox\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/74597bfcfb.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"224\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A bar graph compares the concentrations of various toxic hydrocarbons from Southall Old Gasworks Soil Hospital across different monitoring periods in 2018 and 2019, highlighting levels of Benzene, Naphthalene, Toluene, Xylene, Trimethylbenzenes, and 4-Iso-propyltoluene with legal limits indicated for Benzene and Naphthalene.\">\n\n\nOnly in Southall can carcinogenic benzene, and naphthalene - which is known to be potentially [fatal to some people with African and Asian heritage](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3850774/) - be released into the air from the Gasworks development at levels way [above legal limits](https://youtu.be/CGGyCDAHRt4?si=OtAGYXGA2CQ1y3q5&utm_source=MTQxZ) and be simultaneously \"not hazardous\" according to Ealing Council. \n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/6624f74972.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"254\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Ealing Council tweets that they are monitoring reports of strong odours at a Berkeley Group construction site in Southall Gasworks, assuring the odours aren't hazardous and should clear in a few days.\">\n\n\nOne moment the Headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School is [reporting asthma and headaches](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hB66yX40-q-YYi6EKOTvE20DTx422_g3/view?usp=drivesdk) [p. 10] caused by very strong smells from the Gasworks site; in another moment, the developer's head of construction is appointed to the school's board of governors [pp. 7-8] and arranges to remove dead rats from the nursery playground [p. 11]. These events are clearly unconnected.\n\n\nIt's all perfectly normal in Southall, where [kids can be locked in class without ventilation on hot days](https://www.change.org/p/cleanair-for-southall-and-hayes-stop-berkeleygroupuk-s-southallwaterside-polluting-our-kids-southalllivesmatter/u/23019750) to protect them from the harmless petrol odour, and the developer's \"community liaison officer\" can [simultaneously](https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1926034207492407709) be the chair of Southall's charity umbrella organisation, an ex-Tory tobacco salesman whose former employer [paid for our ex-MP's research assistant](https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1630863285892333569) to attend a jolly. Nothing to see here!\n\n\nHere's where things get even more interesting. The Council's own \"[Southall Reset](https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s1726/Southall%20Reset.pdf)\" [pdf] document acknowledges that \"challenges of deprivation, low pay, are particularly acute\" in Southall, contributing to \"deeply embedded health and wellbeing challenges.\" \n\n\nThe Race Equality Commission Report \"highlighted the need for an investment in adequate primary care in Southall\" and \"deeper meaningful engagement, and better conversations with residents.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/6d6e997a4e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"143\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Challenges in Southall include deprivation, low pay, and the need for improved primary care and community engagement.\">\n\n\nThe Council's response to this need for MORE investment? Close children's centres.\n\n\n\"So you know we need MORE investment?\" Mrs. Patel asked.\n\n\n\"Absolutely. The evidence is clear,\" they said.\n\n\n\"Then why are you closing children's centres?\"\n\n\n\"Budget pressures.\"\n\n\n\"But your own report says we need more investment, not less.\"\n\n\n\"That's a different report.\"\n\n\n\"It's your report. You wrote it.\"\n\n\n\"Different department.\"\n\n\n\"Same council.\"\n\n\n\"Different budget.\"\n\n\n\"Same money.\"\n\n\n\"You don't understand local government.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. They could officially acknowledge that Southall needed more investment while simultaneously cutting investment. They could document the problem and implement policies that made it worse. Each document existed in its own logical universe, disconnected from actual decisions.\n\n\n## Chapter 6: The MIPIM Negotiations\n\n\nEvery year, the Council Leader attends MIPIM in Cannes - what Private Eye calls a \"[booze 'n' hookerfest](https://stopthetowers.info/the-mipim-jolly)\" - with expenses paid by Berkeley Group, the company behind the gasworks development that's been poisoning Southall residents.\n\n\nHe goes to \"negotiate hard\" with developers.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/cac51e7bb8.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"650\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses negotiating for genuinely affordable homes at MIPIM, contrasting it with the idea of it being a holiday.\">\n\n\nThe documented results of these negotiations:\n- More developments approved\n- Continued toxic air from gasworks\n- Larger councillor allowances\n- Closure of community facilities\n\n\nEither he's a remarkably poor negotiator, or \"negotiating hard\" means something different in Cannes than it does in English.\n\n\n## Chapter 7: The Zionist-Anti-Zionist Synthesis \n\n\nThe Council Leader represents Southall Green - 69% BAME, one of the most ethnically diverse wards in Britain. Many of his constituents have strong views about Palestinian liberation.\n\n\nHis attitude? \"People who commit themselves to being opposed to Jewish national self determination / liberation aren't my cup of tea. They can exist, sure, just outside of the Labour movement.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/160bd2a958.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"382\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person shares their perspective on anti-Zionism and Jewish national self-determination in a social media post.\">\n\n\nSo he simultaneously represents a diverse community while working to exclude people from that community based on their views about Middle Eastern politics.\n\n\nIt's a masterclass in representation: represent everyone, except the people whose politics you disagree with.\n\n\n## Chapter 8: The Protection-by-Destruction Innovation\n\n\nThe Council Leader has pioneered a new approach to public service: protecting things by eliminating them.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/c19f8ce2da.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"356\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason responds to Tom Gann, defending a decision to protect frontline services instead of cutting them.\">\n\n\n\"We've made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Govt Commissioners to slash and burn services,\" he explains, while slashing and burning services.\n\n\nIt was like watching someone slash the low-hanging fruit on the trees and then set fire to the orchard; then selling the \"infertile land\" to developers when there's nothing to eat.\n\n\nBut that wasn't even the worst part. Mrs. Patel had discovered something even more troubling. Back in 2012, a group of unelected businessmen had met to play [Monopoly](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W2HRPD00OiidxP9iAlLPDFHPVwZcEfeM/view?usp=drivesdk) [pdf] with public assets. Not the board game - though the principle was identical. They wanted to \"sell off our public assets for £20m profit.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/deb63dd611.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"703\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Monopoly game board is shown with green houses scattered on the board and the surrounding table.\">\n\n\nTheir target included \"buildings used for services for vulnerable adults, children and families.\"\n\n\n\"So they planned this years ago?\" Mrs. Patel asked the councillor.\n\n\n\"I wouldn't know anything about that,\" the councillor said.\n\n\n\"But you're closing children's centres,\" Mrs. Patel said.\n\n\n\"We're protecting services by cutting them,\" they explained patiently. \"We've made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Government Commissioners to slash and burn services.\"\n\n\n\"But you ARE slashing and burning services.\"\n\n\n\"We're protecting them by cutting them responsibly.\"\n\n\n\"How is closing them protecting them?\"\n\n\n\"If we don't close them, someone else will close them worse.\"\n\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f5fcab7334.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"365\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses the importance of members shaping manifestos and taking responsibility for decisions, emphasizing the role of residents.\">\n\n\n\"The Government Commissioners.\"\n\n\n\"Have they said they'll close them?\"\n\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\n\"So you're closing them to prevent them being closed?\"\n\n\n\"We're protecting them by cutting them.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Round and round she went, trapped in a perfectly logical system designed to make resistance impossible.\n\n\nThe beautiful thing was that everyone was telling the truth. The councillor really didn't know about the 2012 meeting. The 2012 meeting really had happened. The plan really was being implemented. Nobody was really in charge of implementing it.\n\n\nSomehow, a decision made by people who didn't officially exist was being executed by people who officially couldn't stop it.\nThis allows him to be simultaneously the protector of services and the person closing services - a remarkable administrative innovation.\n\n\n## Chapter 9: Democracy 2.0 - Now With Less Democracy\n\n\nBut the system's crowning achievement is happening right now. **This month - July 2025 - Ealing Council is rewriting the petition rules** in direct response to successful community campaigns.\n\n\nOn page 294 of their July 15, 2025 council [papers](https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g6611/Public%20reports%20pack%20Tuesday%2015-Jul-2025%2019.00%20Council.pdf?T=10) [pdf, see p. 294], you can see democracy being crossed out in real time. They're removing:\n- Residents' rights to ask follow-up questions\n- Requirements for senior officers to give evidence  \n- Meaningful participation in debates about their own petitions\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/8439aacef6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"347\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: The document contains redlined text showing revisions related to the procedures for responding to petitions and presenting debates before the Council.\">\n\n\nThey've solved the democracy problem by removing the democratic bits from democracy. \n\n\nThe timing is perfect: after communities proved they could win by building independent pressure (Save Southall Young Adult Centre, Save Southall Town Hall, Save Warren Farm Nature Reserve), the council is changing the rules to prevent it happening again.\n\n\nSoon residents will be able to petition - they just won't be able to ask questions, get answers, or participate in discussions about their concerns.\n\n\nIt's democracy in name only, which is much more efficient than the old democracy where people could actually influence things.\n\n\n## Chapter 10: The Southall Young Adult Centre Miracle\n\n\nBut here's the thing - resistance is still possible. In 2022, the Council wanted to demolish Southall Young Adult Centre to build 60 flats. The usual process commenced: consultation theater, predetermined decisions, official helplessness.\n\n\nThen the \"Save Southall Young Adult Centre\" campaign launched. They didn't try to work within the impossible system. They built independent pressure. They refused to accept that \"decisions had been made.\"\n\n\nThey [won](https://www.visitsouthall.co.uk/News/NewsDetails.php?recordID=1235).\n\n\nThe centre was saved.\n\n\n\"How?\" Mrs. Patel asked.\n\n\n\"We stopped playing by their rules,\" the organisers said. \"We built power they couldn't ignore.\"\n\n\n## Chapter 11: The Impossible Solution\n\n\nMrs. Patel realized the children's centres could be saved the same way. But it would require doing something the system said was impossible: organising outside the official channels, building independent power, refusing to accept predetermined outcomes.\n\n\nThe Council had just changed the petition rules specifically to prevent another people-powered victory. But that only proved they were afraid of effective organising.\n\n\nThe system's weakness was its strength: it was so obviously absurd that anyone paying attention could see through it.\n\n\nThe Council Leader could tweet about putting \"people before buildings\" while closing buildings where people accessed services. He could claim to protect services while cutting them. He could represent diverse communities while excluding their political views. He could prioritize eels over children and call it environmentalism.\n\n\nAll of this was only possible because residents had been playing by rules designed to make them lose.\n\n\nBut the campaigns to save the Young Adult Centre, the Town Hall and Warren Farm proved the rules could be broken.\n\n\n## Chapter 12: The Choice\n\n\nMrs. Patel had a choice. She could continue navigating the impossible bureaucracy, filing petitions that couldn't ask questions, attending consultations about predetermined decisions, lobbying councillors who claimed to have no power.\n\n\nOr she could do what the other campaigners did: build independent power and refuse to accept defeat.\n\n\nThe children's centres could be saved. But only if parents stopped trying to reason with an unreasonable system and started building the power to change it.\n\n\nThe Council Leader would continue inhabiting his world of simultaneous contradictions, where closing centres meant protecting them and cutting services meant investing in communities.\n\n\nBut Mrs. Patel had learned something important: impossible things happen every day in Ealing politics.\n\n\nIf the Council Leader could be simultaneously progressive and regressive, protective and destructive, representative and exclusionary, then maybe Mrs. Patel could do something equally impossible.\n\n\nLike save a children's centre. \n\n\nThe Young Adult Centre campaigners had already shown it could be done.\n\n\nNow it was the children's centres' turn. \n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Even this right wing authoritarian Labour government thinks it's a [bad idea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvj1jr0kz0o) to close children's centres. \n\n## Chapter 13: The Engagement Paradox  \n\nThe Council Leader had perfected the art of simultaneous engagement.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b26d191a08.jpg\" width=\"496\" height=\"499\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A group of people holding protest signs gathers at night, with a tweet from Peter Mason about planning rules and community engagement.\">  \n\nHe could tweet about \"absolutely committed to engaging, listening and compromising\" while sharing photos of residents protesting his refusal to engage, listen, or compromise.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/117ce072a1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1020\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two social media posts promote a webinar and report launch about public engagement and planning for the future, by inviting people to join discussions on connected platforms.\">  \n\nHe spoke frequently about \"transparent engagement\" and \"finding the compromises everyone needs to make\" - usually while explaining why the compromises residents needed to make were accepting whatever he'd already decided.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/10069a5050.jpg\" width=\"496\" height=\"386\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet mentions a public meeting about Ealing's Local Plan, focusing on growth, priorities, challenges, and future planning.\">  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7e95b424b9.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"474\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses the goal of campaigning and highlights that Twitter is often a zero-sum game.\">\n\nEven councillors who were \"most responsive\" resigned rather than \"effectively endorse his toxic brand of politics.\"  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/76b65af2ac.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"565\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet expresses disappointment over a local councillor's resignation due to opposition to a colleague's political approach.\">  \n\nBut the real innovation was tweeting \"Welcome to Dystopia\" while creating it.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/4264ddab3e.jpg\" width=\"496\" height=\"624\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses the limits of conservative populism and the exploitation of rhetoric, with a highlighted quote on the consequences for demagogues.\">  \n\n## Chapter 14: The Investment Paradox \n\n\nThe Council Leader had achieved something remarkable: he could simultaneously remember genocide while investing in it. \"Remember Yesterday, Act Today,\" his council posted about the genocide of 8,732 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica thirty years ago, while [investing £112 million](https://lgpsdivest.org/lgps-investments/) in companies enabling genocide of [more than 28,000 women and girls](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/news/2025/05/un-women-estimates-over-28000-women-and-girls-killed-in-gaza-since-october-2023) in Gaza today. [More than 50,000 children killed or injured](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unimaginable-horrors-more-50000-children-reportedly-killed-or-injured-gaza-strip) in Gaza to pay for his pension. \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/d7a8763427.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"822\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: White tombstones in a cemetery are shown in a tweet about Srebrenica Memorial Day, which marks the genocide's 30th anniversary.\">\n\nIt was beautifully efficient. Why limit yourself to one genocide when you could remember one while funding another? The children understood perfectly.\n\n\nEqually impressive was his ability to close children's centres for budget reasons while sitting on the board as a [paid director](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/opdc_2020.21_audited_annual_report_and_accounts.pdf) [pdf] of a corporation that had just received £140 million in public funding. The logic was flawless: children's services were unaffordable, but corporate development was essential.\n\n\nThe Council Leader had mastered the art of proportional response. Children's centres closing to save £750,000? Budget pressures, difficult decisions, no choice. Sitting on the board overseeing \"one of the biggest regeneration schemes in Europe\" with £140 million in funding? That was worth £2,000 a year of his valuable time. \n\n\nIt was a masterclass in priorities: Europe's biggest regeneration project required his oversight, but Southall's children's centres were an unaffordable luxury. \n\n\nHe could simultaneously claim there was no money for community services while helping to plan a \"[mini-Manhattan](https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/fresh-pictures-reveal-what-london-22320564)\" in his own borough. The vision was clear: 54-storey towers, yes. Children's centres, no.\n\n\nHe'd found the perfect balance: cut services locally to save money, earn money regionally to oversee developers' profits. It was like a perpetual motion machine of fiscal responsibility.\n\n\n## Chapter and Verse: The Evolution of Enlightenment\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/401141c2e5.jpg\" width=\"579\" height=\"697\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A social media post humorously discusses attending a meeting where Punjabi is spoken, with a suggestion to nod and interject occasionally.\">\n\n\nIn 2010, our future Council Leader shared his frustration about \"sitting around not understanding all this punjabi\" at community meetings in the area he would later represent. \n\n\nBy 2020, he had evolved. \"Words have consequences,\" he tweeted. \"Impact is as important as intent. Culture is defined by leadership.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7db676b2d0.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"682\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Twitter post emphasizes the importance of learning lessons about the consequences of words, the significance of impact, leadership in culture, and the possibility of redemption, encouraging reflection or change.\">\n\n\nTen years of personal growth had taught him that words matter. Which made it remarkable that he could simultaneously lecture about cultural sensitivity while closing community centres in the same diverse communities he'd once struggled to understand. It was a masterclass in progressive evolution: you could acknowledge that words have consequences while ensuring your own words from the past had none.\n\n\n## Disclaimer \n\n\nReaders who think this is all a bit unfair, unbelievable, unhelpful or downright unlawful...\n\n\nThe most revealing evidence of how the system works came from inside the machine itself. In 2022, [leaked WhatsApp messages](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hZfSB-RR7OzeCIHclKdiJd_FTnUtT7KA/view?usp=drivesdk) [pdf] from the Ealing Labour councillors' group chat revealed what they really thought about their leadership.\n\n\nMason's own Labour colleagues called the Council Leader \"callous, ruthless, sectarian.\" \n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/c0b6a01f21.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A group chat conversation appears on a phone screen, discussing leadership support and political opinions, with messages from multiple participants.\">\n\n\nThey discussed votes of no confidence, referenced \"corruption and even theft\" regarding the previous leader, and debated \"bribes\" and \"rewards\" for loyalty. Meanwhile, publicly, they maintained perfect unity and collective responsibility. It was the perfect illustration of how the system works: private recognition of the problems, public performance of harmony. \n\n\nMrs. Patel understood perfectly. The same councillors who privately criticised authoritarian leadership accepted Mason's cabinet positions and pay rises to sit in silent support during council meetings.The leaked messages proved Mrs. Patel wasn't imagining the contradictions - even the people inside the system could see them. They just couldn't say so publicly.\n\n---\n\nURGENT support to fund a [legal challenge](https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-ealings-childrens-centres/) to Ealing Council's decision to close 10 children's centres.\n\n\n*Sources: All tweets, council documents, and quotes are publicly available and linked in the original post at [https://davidmarsden.info/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local.html](https://davidmarsden.info/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local.html)*\n\n\nTry your hand at [democracy in Ealing](https://ealing.netlify.app/interactive.html) with our fun interactive FAQs, budget calculator and decision-making process explainer!\n\n\n*Related reading: [Southall Under Siege](https://davidmarsden.info/2019/08/25/southall-under-siege.html) | [The Property Lobby](https://davidmarsden.info/2022/12/16/the-property-lobby.html) | [Air Quality Strategy Response](https://davidmarsden.info/2023/01/16/air-quality-strategy.html) | [Action you can take](https://davidmarsden.info/2025/03/09/save-ealings-childrens-centres.html) | [Think of the children](https://davidmarsden.info/2025/03/12/ealing-council-are-consulting-on.html) | [Save Ealing Children's Centres (official campaign website)](https://saveealingchildrenscentres.wordpress.com/)*\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I step out of my house and immediately notice the artificial &ldquo;cotton fresh&rdquo; scent of odour suppressants wafting south from the old Gasworks site. How can this be? They finished remediating the contaminated earth in 2019, and people have been living there in the new homes they built since 2021.</p>\n<p>Still, it&rsquo;s better than the smell of petrol, which is what we had to put up with day and night for months on end in 2018. Bad enough to wake us up in the night during the long hot summer.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s better than the smell of tar, which we still get when the wind is blowing from the west. Before the asphalt plant was built, we didn&rsquo;t get any odours even though there is also a Tarmac plant nearby. The Asphalt plant owners say that is because the Nestle coffee plant closed. The (burnt?) coffee smell masked the tar.</p>\n<p>I get around the corner of my block, on my morning walk, and see the small industrial estate that was the bane of our life for months in 2022. The main culprits were the paper recylcling company, which had its own incinerator for burning (believe it or not) plastics and coated wooden pallets.</p>\n<p>Their neighbour opposite was a custom kitchen furniture maker, which also had its own incinerator for burning laminated particle fibreboard. The garage at the front regularly burns stuff in an old oil barrel.</p>\n<p>All of which contributed to some of the most disgusting odours imaginable blowing into our kitchen, bathroom and hallway whe the wind blew from the north-east.</p>\n<p>I walked down the street to the corner where the local council installed a tiny corner &ldquo;wildflower garden&rdquo;, which my wife and kids loved because it smelled so good.

				"content_text": "I step out of my house and immediately notice the artificial \"cotton fresh\" scent of odour suppressants wafting south from the old Gasworks site. How can this be? They finished remediating the contaminated earth in 2019, and people have been living there in the new homes they built since 2021.\n\n\nStill, it's better than the smell of petrol, which is what we had to put up with day and night for months on end in 2018. Bad enough to wake us up in the night during the long hot summer.\n\n\nAnd it's better than the smell of tar, which we still get when the wind is blowing from the west. Before the asphalt plant was built, we didn't get any odours even though there is also a Tarmac plant nearby. The Asphalt plant owners say that is because the Nestle coffee plant closed. The (burnt?) coffee smell masked the tar.\n\n\nI get around the corner of my block, on my morning walk, and see the small industrial estate that was the bane of our life for months in 2022. The main culprits were the paper recylcling company, which had its own incinerator for burning (believe it or not) plastics and coated wooden pallets.\n\n\nTheir neighbour opposite was a custom kitchen furniture maker, which also had its own incinerator for burning laminated particle fibreboard. The garage at the front regularly burns stuff in an old oil barrel.\n\n\nAll of which contributed to some of the most disgusting odours imaginable blowing into our kitchen, bathroom and hallway whe the wind blew from the north-east.\n\n\nI walked down the street to the corner where the local council installed a tiny corner \"wildflower garden\", which my wife and kids loved because it smelled so good. Two years later, it's reduced to a dumping ground (no one could have foreseen this).\n\n\n![Auto-generated description: A pile of mattresses, wooden pallets, and other debris is stacked on a sidewalk next to a white car and a trailer.](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/dcc3f14639.jpg)\n\n\nFurther on my walk, past the homes reeking of marijuana, and weaving in and out of the obstacle course of bed bases mattresses and pallets stren across the pavements, I reach the town and smell the food aromas.\n\n\nI'm reminded of the old Honey Monster factory, which used to regale us with the smell of roasted (burnt?) onions (I know, right?). \n\n\nAnd my first visit to Southall (in daylight hours), twenty odd years ago, turning left out of the old station and naively going into the underpass.

The site is highly contaminated with a variety of hazardous chemicals, including benzene, naphthalene, VOCs, PAHs, heavy metals, &ldquo;blue billy&rdquo; and asbestos. These chemicals can cause a variety of health problems, including cancer, respiratory problems, neurological problems, and birth defects. The local community is mostly of south Asian and African heritage, and it is known that people with this heritage can be genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning.

I&rsquo;ll say more on these later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve air quality</li>\n<li>Tackling the climate crisis</li>\n<li>Fighting inequality</li>\n<li>Protect biodiversity</li>\n<li>Protect health and wellbeing</li>\n<li>Raise public awareness</li>\n<li>Promote sustainable infrastructure</li>\n<li>Support the transition to clean energy</li>\n<li>Creating good jobs</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"inequalities\">Inequalities</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/17f94db6cd.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\"></p>\n<p><em>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk in Ealing&rsquo;s air quality strategy about being inclusive and &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; (&ldquo;reducing&rdquo; would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; (&ldquo;exhaust trail&rdquo; might be more apt?). I&rsquo;m not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"public-health-policy\">Public Health Policy</h3>\n<p>The strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks.</p>\n<p><em>When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action</a>), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we&rsquo;ll see later, promoting active travel.</em></p>\n<p>In contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio</a>).</p>\n<p>*There&rsquo;s obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Good Growth</a>), and social policy (<a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Tackling Inequalities</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.</strong></p>\n<p>The strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant.</p>\n<p><em>Ealing&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profiles/2019/E09000009.html?area-name=Ealing\">Health Profile from 2019</a> puts that figure in some context:</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/35109e01b4.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of Ealing&rsquo;s 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\" title=\"Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"air-pollution-in-ealing\">Air Pollution in Ealing</h2>\n<h3 id=\"pollution-sources\">Pollution Sources</h3>\n<p>The strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy.</p>\n<p>Those most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women.</p>\n<p><strong>It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo;, especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).</strong></p>\n<p><em>I don&rsquo;t believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.</em></p>\n<p>The strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.</p>\n<p><em>Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/adc0267e1f.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\"></p>\n<p><em>On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/12c505256e.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\"></p>\n<p><em>In the graphics from the 2017-22 action plan, wood burning doesn&rsquo;t get a look-in at all, data from 2013.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f0df8bd46e.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\"></p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.</strong></p>\n<p><em>The good news is that road traffic emissions, the council&rsquo;s key action area for 2022-30, reduced significantly in Ealing between 2013 and 2019.</em></p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"air-quality-monitoring\">Air Quality Monitoring</h3>\n<p>The strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/0996242a03.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\"></p>\n<p><em>It&rsquo;s worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/pm2.5_in_london_october19.pdf\" title=\"PDF\">background levels of PM2.5</a> in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO&rsquo;s target.</em></p>\n<p>The draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.</p>\n<p>Ealing has 67 air quality monitors across the borough, all recording levels of nitrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulate matter (PM10 only).</p>\n<p><em>It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although there are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as <a href=\"https://www.airqualityengland.co.uk/local-authority/?la_id=191\" title=\"Air Quality England: Southall monitors\">The Green Quarter</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Ealing publishes annual air quality <a href=\"https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/Reports.aspx\">status reports</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Ealing also has <a href=\"https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/DiffusionTubes.aspx\">an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites</a> where you can see graphical annual data summary charts.

Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council&rsquo;s response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn&rsquo;t give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Wouldn&rsquo;t this be fantastic?! Again, the Council&rsquo;s response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents' needs for clean air first, and above developers' desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Invest in green infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Southall has the least <a href=\"https://www.ealingitree.online/stories/canopy-cover/0\" title=\"Tree canopy cover in Ealing\">tree canopy cover in Ealing</a>, yet is subjected to <a href=\"https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns\" title=\"Over-development of Southall\">massive overdevelopment</a>.

Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the &lsquo;reset&rsquo; button. Having sat on the Mayor&rsquo;s money and done nothing for so long it&rsquo;s no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new &lsquo;pocket park&rsquo; outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-&lsquo;orchards&rsquo; planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the &lsquo;Poison Park&rsquo; to look forward to, the &lsquo;green space&rsquo; crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.</em></p>\n<p><strong>If the council&rsquo;s air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a &lsquo;compromise&rsquo; to <a href=\"https://ealing.news/environment/environmentalists-tell-ealing-council-and-its-leader-peter-mason-their-actions-will-result-in-ecocide-and-are-environmentally-reckless-and-ecologically-illiterate-over-warren-farm-sports-p\" title=\"Ealing News coverage of Warren Farm story\">destroy most of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall</a> in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don&rsquo;t want.

It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”. Residents were never informed if, when or how levels of naphthalene were urgently reduced.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7ee1493a47.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council&rsquo;s statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment\" title=\"Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment\"></p>\n<p>It’s noteworthy that the Council claims it asked PHE to get involved only <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201031045353/https://www.ealing.gov.uk/news/article/2035/statement_on_phe_southall_waterside_risk_assessment\" title=\"Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment\">“following concerns raised by local residents”</a> and not because the Council itself carried out an Equalities Impact Assessment prior to works starting in 2016, knowing that the Southall population was significantly more vulnerable to air pollution due to high pre-existing levels and multiple inequalities.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the council says it responded to residents' concerns by installing &ldquo;independent&rdquo; air quality monitors on site in 2021, but this is five years after the work started, and two years after the main source of air pollution and odour complaints (the so-called soil &ldquo;hospital&rdquo;) was decommissioned. The monitors now installed record near-real time data for “urban background” emissions of odourless particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/76615b310f.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns\"></p>\n<p>The odours and air pollution that residents are concerned about originate from polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (i.e., the hundred years’ of toxic waste from town gas, coal tar and petrochemical work sites). We are told that there are diffusion tubes monitoring these emissions, but there is a total lack of openness and transparency as to their locations and the data they have recorded. The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!</p>\n<h3 id=\"public-health\">Public Health</h3>\n<p>We are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. <strong>Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?</strong> The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?</p>\n<p>Moreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years' of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. <strong>Why wasn&rsquo;t truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"enforcement\">Enforcement</h3>\n<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?</p>\n<p>The council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks.

In Southall, we have continuously been asked to ignore our own lived experience of health and quality of life problems attributed to the open-air &lsquo;cleaning&rsquo; of a hundred years of petrochemical waste at the Gasworks site, in favour of the developer Berkeley&rsquo;s assurances that it&rsquo;s own monitoring of air quality is &lsquo;within acceptable limits&rsquo; and harmless to health. Public Health England published four risk assessments based on Berkeley&rsquo;s data, and came to similar conclusions, although neither looked at any secondary data. The air pollution data has still to be published so that the public can make up their own minds.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b26fce3d39.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/a5185741a3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how imperceptible changes that cannot be detected by monitoring or modelling can be interpreted as Low Impact or a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>The Action Plan here seems to contradict the Strategy by stating that changes in the levels of air pollution above a certain level can be attributed even to individual actions (although more likely to be due to multiple actions).</p>\n<p><strong>If the council is serious about using air pollution data and secondary data to establish efficacy of its air quality strategy and action plan, (which sounds sensible enough), then it must explain what measures it will use, and publish baseline data and regular updates.</strong></p>\n<p>Like it does with its <a href=\"https://ealingperformance.inphase.com/Plan/856\" title=\"Ealing Council Performance Dashboard\">performance dashboard</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking at the Council&rsquo;s own evaluation of its 2017-22 Action Plan, I would suggest that its achievements are minimal, and misleading.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/6aa8ea88ed.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan\"></p>\n<p>Electric Vehicle charging points (p. 30 of 2022 AQAP) were not actually a specified target in the 2017 AQAP, so I&rsquo;m unsure how this can be claimed as an achievement?

				"content_text": "Ealing Council's [draft Air Quality Strategy][1] is a 64 page document together with a 40 page [Action Plan][2], and the consultation period runs until 30 January 2023. It's taken me the best part of six weeks, all my spare time over Christmas and New Year, to get through it all, make notes and cross-reference to try to make sense of it all and offer some feedback. \n\nReally, there must be a much longer consultation period if Ealing Council is genuinely interested in residents' views.\n\nThe following is a summary of what the key points of interest are for me, and in particular in relation to Southall, where I live and work. My additional suggestions are **in bold**, and my comments and questions in *italics*.\n\n#### Warning\n\nThis is a LONG post. I've tried to break it into sections to make it easier to read.\n\n#### Disclaimer \n\n*I don't claim to be an expert, other than through experience. I am just an ordinary resident living in the midst of four major industrial and construction site polluters for several years. I have campaigned alongside my family, neighbours and friends for clean air after my then nearly four year old said he wanted fresh air not stinky air. He'd been hospitalised three times when he was two and diagnosed with asthma. We soon discovered people who had lost loved ones, had heart attacks, ectopic pregnancies, cancer, all attributed to the foul petrochemical stink.*\n\n*I welcome any corrections.*\n\n# My Summary\n\n**If Ealing is serious about \"fighting\" inequalities, action must be targeted to protect vulnerable people in Southall to reduce air pollution and its impact on the health of its large, mostly economically deprived and non-white population.**\n\n**The Strategy and Plan must target children and older people, people with lung conditions, and pregnant women: outside schools and school run hours. The Council must question if it is ethical to promote active travel in Southall when it knows that it is a high pollution area and that most of its population is particularly vulnerable to its adverse health impacts.**\n\nThe draft strategy and action plan don't do this at all.\n\n---\n\n# Clean Air for Ealing!\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/3141352312.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents\")\n\n*To begin, I think it’s fantastic that Ealing Council has stated its vision for clean air for all Ealing residents, in alignment with that of local residents’ campaign group [Clean Air for Southall and Hayes][3] (CASH).*\n\n*CASH has been [asking for clean air for residents in Southall and Hayes since 2018][4].*\n\n![Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a community group fighting for our right to breathe clean air](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/feee9005e2.jpg \"Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a community group fighting for our right to breathe clean air\")\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the Strategy and Action Plan\n\nEaling's draft air quality strategy's five stated priorities are to:\n\n> - Reduce road traffic emissions\n> - Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning\n> - Reduce emissions from construction of new developments\n> - Invest in green infrastructure\n> - Raise awareness of air quality\n\n**It would be useful to see the strategy and action plan follow the same structure with clear definitions of terms, and specific and detailed aims and objectives for each priority, along with baseline air pollution levels and equalities data for each in order to monitor and measure impact.**\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/1629717036.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport\")\n\nSomewhat confusingly, the action plan groups its actions into six categories: \n\n> - Emissions from Developments and Buildings\n> - Public health and awareness raising\n> - Delivery servicing and freight\n> - Borough fleet actions\n> - Localised solutions\n> - Cleaner transport\n\n*This maybe because they are copied and pasted from the previous [2017-22 action plan][5].*\n\n**It would be better for understanding, monitoring and evaluation to have consistency and coherence between the two documents, updating the action plan where necessary to reflect this.**\n\nAlso somewhat confusingly, Ealing's draft air quality strategy has nine stated goals, starting with the obvious. I'll say more on these later:\n\n> 1. Improve air quality\n> 2. Tackling the climate crisis\n> 3. Fighting inequality\n> 4. Protect biodiversity\n> 5. Protect health and wellbeing\n> 6. Raise public awareness\n> 7. Promote sustainable infrastructure\n> 8. Support the transition to clean energy\n> 9. Creating good jobs\n\n---\n\n### Inequalities \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/17f94db6cd.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\")\n\n*There's a lot of talk in Ealing's air quality strategy about being inclusive and \"fighting\" (\"reducing\" would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution \"footprint\" (\"exhaust trail\" might be more apt?). I'm not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.*\n\n---\n\n### Public Health Policy\n\nThe strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks. \n\n*When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the [Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action][6]), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we'll see later, promoting active travel.*\n\nIn contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing's [Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio][6]).\n\n*There's obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or [Good Growth][6]), and social policy ([Tackling Inequalities][6]). \n\n**It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.**\n\nThe strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant. \n\n*Ealing's [Health Profile from 2019][7] puts that figure in some context:*\n\n![Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/35109e01b4.jpg \"Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\")\n\n---\n\n## Air Pollution in Ealing\n\n### Pollution Sources \n\nThe strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy. \n\nThose most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women. \n\n**It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution \"hotspots\", especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).** \n\n*I don't believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.*\n\nThe strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.\n\n*Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).*\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/adc0267e1f.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\")\n\n*On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):*\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/12c505256e.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\")\n\n*In the graphics from the 2017-22 action plan, wood burning doesn't get a look-in at all, data from 2013.* \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f0df8bd46e.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\")\n\n**It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.**\n\n*The good news is that road traffic emissions, the council's key action area for 2022-30, reduced significantly in Ealing between 2013 and 2019.* \n\n**It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.**\n\n---\n\n### Air Quality Monitoring \n\nThe strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/0996242a03.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\")\n\n*It's worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the [background levels of PM2.5][8] in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO's target.*\n\nThe draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.\n\nEaling has 67 air quality monitors across the borough, all recording levels of nitrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulate matter (PM10 only). \n\n*It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although there are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as [The Green Quarter][9].*\n\nEaling publishes annual air quality [status reports][10].\n\n*Ealing also has [an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites][11] where you can see graphical annual data summary charts. Unfortunately, none seem to have been updated since 2021.*\n\n![Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/58dfd151de.jpg \"Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021\") \n\n**It would be useful to have more monitors for particulate matter, especially PM2.5, across the borough, and in Southall, and for published data from all air pollution monitors to be kept accessible and up-to-date.**\n\n---\n\n## Priorities for Action\n\nBack to the strategy's priorities for action, and my *comments and questions*, and **suggestions**.\n\n> - Reduce road traffic emissions. \n\n*The biggest reduction in road traffic emissions came during 2020 covid lockdowns, and while it's not practical, feasible or desirable to replicate that going forward, it might be worth promoting the idea that employers should encourage and support an increase to the 36% of Ealing's working age population already mainly [working from home][12] whenever possible, as opposed to the current political groupthink that everyone must return to the office in order to be productive.*\n\n> - Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning. \n\n*There are two wood-burning incinerators close to my home, which frequently create disgusting burning plastic odours forcing us to stay indoors and close all our windows. Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council's response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn't give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.*\n\n> - Reduce emissions from construction of new developments. \n\n*Wouldn't this be fantastic?! Again, the Council's response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents' needs for clean air first, and above developers' desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?*\n\n> - Invest in green infrastructure. \n\n*Southall has the least [tree canopy cover in Ealing][13], yet is subjected to [massive overdevelopment][14]. This almost entirely terraced town is being transformed into a new Manhattan.* \n\n*The one concession negotiated hard by our elected representatives, and granted by the London Mayor for overruling local democracy to allow the Gasworks development, was to widen the South Road bridge by the train station to ease the often gridlocked road. Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the 'reset' button. Having sat on the Mayor's money and done nothing for so long it's no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new 'pocket park' outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-'orchards' planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the 'Poison Park' to look forward to, the 'green space' crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.*\n\n**If the council's air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.** \n\n*Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a 'compromise' to [destroy most of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall][15] in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don't want. I don't understand how the Leader's desires complement the Council's stated strategies to reduce air pollution, tackle the climate emergency they declared, and to protect and promote biodiversity and our ecosystem.*\n\n- Raise awareness of air quality. \n\n*The council also wants to (and must) lead by example.* \n\n**If the council really wants to lead by example on reducing air pollution, then the council Leader cannot accept or request car rides to or from meetings in Southall, councillors cannot park in cycle lanes in Southall, nor fly to the property developer festival in the south of France. They must engage with Southall residents suffering the worst of the air pollution from multiple sources, and stop denying or minimising the existence and extent of the problems, and proactively and collaboratively work to reduce or stop such pollution episodes continuing.** \n\n*Otherwise, the council's strategy isn't worth the virtual paper it's printed on, and is just more hot air.*\n\n*What we have in the draft plan, however, is largely a copy-and-paste of the previous 2017-2022 plan, which was, at worst, a demonstrable failure of ambition, leadership and political will, and, at best, a simple failure of the council to do what it said it would do.*\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Goals\n\n> 1. Improve air quality. Protect the health and wellbeing of Ealing residents from the harmful effects\n> of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) air pollution. \n\n**The strategy MUST have the inclusive goal of protecting residents from the harmful effects of ALL air pollutants (not just nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter).**.\n\n> 2. Tackling the climate crisis.... by aiming for the highest environmental standards. \n\n**The \"highest environmental standards\" must be clearly stated and defined.**\n\n> 3. Fighting inequality.... to ensure that no-one is left behind... [and] residents feel safe. \n\n**The strategy must ensure that inequalities are reduced, that ALL residents are included in this process, and that their concerns for the safety of their air are taken seriously and acted upon.** *Promoting the uptake of expensive electric vehicles and discounting parking spaces for them is discriminating against economically deprived mostly non-white people who suffer most from air pollution.*\n\n> 4. Protect biodiversity. Ensuring our parks, open spaces and nature are protected and enhanced. \n\n*This is particularly relevant right now, as the Council Leader pushes on with his undemocratic desire to destroy much of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall, and killing off a quarter of London's endangered skylarks, in order to build new sports pitches and/or a football stadium.*\n\n> 5. Protect health and wellbeing. Protecting and enhancing the physical and mental health of all. \n\n*Except in Southall? [Public Health England's four risk assessment reports][16] into the Southall Gasworks poisoning clearly stated that \"Odours can cause nuisance amongst the population possibly leading to stress and anxiety. Some people may experience symptoms such as nausea, headaches or dizziness.\"*\n\n> 6. Raise public awareness. Promoting awareness of the causes and impacts of air quality issues, as well as the available local solutions.... encouraging community activism.... \n\n*Except in Southall? At every opportunity, Ealing Council has sought to erase, deny or minimise the causes and impacts of air quality issues related to Southall Gasworks, refused to enforce any local solutions, and actively discouraged and attempted to prevent community activists' voices from being heard.*\n\n> 7. Promote sustainable infrastructure. Ensure local transport and development planning supports investment in sustainable infrastructure, that limits impact on air quality, enabling a shift to low-emission transport and energy options. \n\n*Except in Southall? The Council recently [decided NOT to widen the South Road bridge in Southall][17]. Widening the bridge, as promised, would ease congestion, and improve air quality, public transport and active travel options. The bridge widening was the one concession granted to the Southall community when the London Mayor overruled local democracy to give the go ahead to development of the highly contaminated Southall Gasworks site.*\n\n> 8. Support the transition to clean energy. Supporting the uptake of low-emission energy technologies and improvements in efficiencies, and reducing reliance on the consumption of fossil and solid fuels. \n\n*Like [in Chile][18]? Simply promoting and encouraging more (low emission) cars isn’t going to reduce congestion, emissions from brake and tyre wear, or help to reduce our “reliance on the consumption of fossil fuels”. Ealing [reportedly doesn’t have enough power on the electricity grid for new homes until 2030][19].* \n\n> 9. Creating good jobs. We want to... deliver an ambitious programme of building more genuinely affordable homes. \n\n*Ealing is [building fewer genuinely affordable homes than ever][20], and [making the housing crisis in Ealing worse][21] by [demolishing more social rent homes][22] than it is building.*\n\n---\n\n## Spotlight on Southall \n\nThese are all my comments, so I'm not putting it all in *italics.*\n\nMy suggestions and questions for the strategy are still in **bold.**\n\n**Southall cannot be used as a good example of how Ealing Council takes air pollution seriously.** \n\n### Inequalities\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b507cd1558.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people\") \n\nSouthall has a [BAME population of more than 90%][23].\n\nSouthall Broadway/West and Southall Green are the two council wards that border the old Gasworks site, and which are downwind from the FM Conway asphalt and Tarmac plants, and the two wood-burning incinerators, depending on wind direction. They are connected by the Gasworks site and by the Air Quality Focus Area from South Road to The Green, King Street and Western Road.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/620d0a35d2.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites\")\n\nSouthall is already a high pollution area (and an Air Quality Focus Area as a result), but has several additive sources of unmitigated, uncontrolled air pollution.\n\nEconomically poorer, BAME people, children, older people and pregnant women are the most vulnerable to the health impacts of toxic air pollution. Certainly not a fairer start for Southall’s children.\n\nWe know from bitter experience over the last six years in Southall that the council has failed in its duty to protect some of its most vulnerable residents from harm.\n\n### Raising Awareness\n\nTo add insult to injury, the council failed to raise public awareness of the risks and the air quality monitoring data in an open and transparent manner before work on the site began, and while the work was in progress. It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”. Residents were never informed if, when or how levels of naphthalene were urgently reduced.\n\n![Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7ee1493a47.jpg \"Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment\")\n\nIt’s noteworthy that the Council claims it asked PHE to get involved only [“following concerns raised by local residents”][24] and not because the Council itself carried out an Equalities Impact Assessment prior to works starting in 2016, knowing that the Southall population was significantly more vulnerable to air pollution due to high pre-existing levels and multiple inequalities.\n\nSimilarly, the council says it responded to residents' concerns by installing \"independent\" air quality monitors on site in 2021, but this is five years after the work started, and two years after the main source of air pollution and odour complaints (the so-called soil \"hospital\") was decommissioned. The monitors now installed record near-real time data for “urban background” emissions of odourless particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/76615b310f.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns\")\n\nThe odours and air pollution that residents are concerned about originate from polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (i.e., the hundred years’ of toxic waste from town gas, coal tar and petrochemical work sites). We are told that there are diffusion tubes monitoring these emissions, but there is a total lack of openness and transparency as to their locations and the data they have recorded. The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!\n\n### Public Health\n\nWe are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. **Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?** The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?\n\nMoreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years' of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and \"cleaned\" in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. **Why wasn't truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?**\n\n### Enforcement\n\nWhy didn't the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?\n\nThe council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks. Indeed half of the plan was missing from the planning portal and [the council admitted that it didn't have a full copy of the original CMP][25]. \n\n**How on earth was the council planning to enforce a CMP it wasn’t in possession of?** This was a gross dereliction of duty to care for the health and wellbeing of (by its own definition) the most vulnerable residents in the borough.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/43138639f4.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites\")\n\n**The Council was committed to full enclosure of waste sites in its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan. Why wasn’t the one hundred years of petrochemical waste \"soil cleaning hospital” enclosed?**\n\n[National Grid have enclosed their enclosed their soil remediation work][26] specifically to avoid causing odour nuisance to the local community (and thanks no doubt to campaigning by local residents and activists at Clean Air for Southall and Hayes).\n\n### On Whose Side?\n\nWhy did the former and current council leader [accept over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group][27] to fly (!) to the south of France for what Private Eye Magazine describes as [a booze and hookerfest][28]?\n\nThe new council leader claims he went there to negotiate hard. If that's the case, what did he negotiate? He also claimed that it wasn't what he expected and that it was a mistake to go. If that's also the case, [why was it a mistake][29]?\n\n**How can we be sure that the new council leader and his administration won't continue making these mistakes and taking the side of developers rather than standing up for the residents they are elected to represent?**\n\n### Local  Action\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/726113aef4.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response\")\n\n**If the soil is now clean and the air is safe to breathe, why would stopping works during hot weather (which didn’t happen in 2018), and covering stockpiles (why weren’t they covered already?) be given as examples of possible mitigating actions?**\n\n**There must be a new commitment to work with and for residents where these are issues. Air pollution and odour nuisance reporting and investigation procedures need to be overhauled as they are currently not fit for purpose (reporting process too convoluted, each one investigated as a single, isolated incident rather than as part of an ongoing problem, residents are simply not believed and our reports are minimised and invalidated).** \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/2cf1bdd0de.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality\")\n\n**Work on the Gasworks site is due to complete in 2038. Why is the date for net-zero emissions set for twelve years after this date in 2050?**\n\nThere's a similar commitment to target zero-emissions for construction vehicles by 2040, which is two years after the new draft local Plan period for new developments ends. \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/4843e8295e.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers\")\n\n**What has Ealing Council done to date to campaign for greater regulatory powers and for a Clean Air Act? Please give examples.**\n\nThis draft Air Quality Strategy is fine in many respects in terms of the words it contains, but what concerns me is that these are empty words if they are not acted on and enforced.\n\nRecent history strongly suggests the council doesn't have the leadership, organisational culture or political will to act in the interests of its most vulnerable residents in Southall.\n\n### Active Travel\n\nThere's a lot of talk about active travel and Ealing Council's multi-million pound Let's Go Southall campaign in the draft Strategy, but [very little on its real cost and impact][31]. They seem to have about 50 regular weekly activity groups. Over two years that's 5,000 sessions. 30,000 attendances (not individuals). So average of six people per session? 1,000 people attended at least two sessions (repeat attendances). My guess would be not many more than 1,000 in total, most will be repeaters (thinking GP referrals, lots of organisers?). If it's helped 1,000 individuals, that's £5,400 per person. If 10,000 it's £540 per person (still seems like a lot of money). And there's no evidence that it's helped anyone! \n\n**The council must be open and transparent with residents that Let's Go Southall is a top-down neoliberal behavioural change (\"nudge theory\") programme led by a retired stockbroker, and not the \"grassroots social movement\" of the council's Orwellian publicity.**\n\n**If the Council is serious about improving safe active travel options in Southall, then it must improve road and pavement conditions and safety first. Many of the roads and pavements are not fit to cycle or walk on, especially for children and families, older people, and people with disabilities.**\n\n---\n\n# Air Quality Action Plan\n\n## The 2017-2022 Action Plan\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f573809dce.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution\")\n\na. Included a number of no-or-low-impact schemes such as Low Emission Neighbourhoods (LENs), implemented in 2021 as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. **Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?**\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/8be373b743.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution\")\n\nb. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. **Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.**\n\nc. Another low impact scheme was Play Streets. **How many Play Streets are there now? How often do they run? Where are they?**\n\nd. **How many Pocket Parks are there? Where are they?**\n\ne. **How many Green Screens  are there? Where are they? Why were green screens not erected at Southall Gasworks even after residents complained of dust from the site in their homes?**\n\nf. **How are these schemes evaluated in terms of reducing air pollution? Where are the air quality monitors located to record baseline measurements to compare against air pollution levels during or after the scheme is in place?**\n\ng. **Enforcement of anti-idling laws was deemed \"not cost-effective\". Smoke control was not deemed a problem and therefore not promoted or enforced. Who made these decisions?**\n\nh. **What is the wider 'cost' to residents in not taking enforcement action against these criminal behaviours?**\n\n## The 2022-2027 Action Plan (AQAP)\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/73f624c5da.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone\")\n\n**If air pollution monitoring data cannot inform the efficacy of individual actions, how can it be used in combination with secondary data to do so?** I'm sure there must be a sensible explanation, but to most people I suspect this statement makes little sense. In Southall, we have continuously been asked to ignore our own lived experience of health and quality of life problems attributed to the open-air 'cleaning' of a hundred years of petrochemical waste at the Gasworks site, in favour of the developer Berkeley's assurances that it's own monitoring of air quality is 'within acceptable limits' and harmless to health. Public Health England published four risk assessments based on Berkeley's data, and came to similar conclusions, although neither looked at any secondary data. The air pollution data has still to be published so that the public can make up their own minds.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b26fce3d39.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution\")\n\n![](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/a5185741a3.jpg)\n\nI'm not sure how imperceptible changes that cannot be detected by monitoring or modelling can be interpreted as Low Impact or a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Action Plan here seems to contradict the Strategy by stating that changes in the levels of air pollution above a certain level can be attributed even to individual actions (although more likely to be due to multiple actions).\n\n**If the council is serious about using air pollution data and secondary data to establish efficacy of its air quality strategy and action plan, (which sounds sensible enough), then it must explain what measures it will use, and publish baseline data and regular updates.** \n\nLike it does with its [performance dashboard][30].  \n  \nLooking at the Council's own evaluation of its 2017-22 Action Plan, I would suggest that its achievements are minimal, and misleading.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/6aa8ea88ed.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan\")\n\nElectric Vehicle charging points (p. 30 of 2022 AQAP) were not actually a specified target in the 2017 AQAP, so I'm unsure how this can be claimed as an achievement? Similarly with School Streets and specific cycle lanes. LENS/LTNs were specified as a target, but there is no mention of that fiasco here. **Air quality monitoring data must be used to locate pollution hotspots for any future implementation of LENs/LTNs**\n\nThe 20 mph speed limit was implemented borough-wide, but only since December 2021. Why did it take so long? What is the use of it if it isn’t enforced, especially in Southall?  \n  \n[1]: https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7039/ealing_council_air_quality_strategy_2020-30\n\n[2]:

Ever!</p>\n\n<p>Ealing Council Leader Julian Bell publicly blamed 'the wrong kind of wind', and – quite possibly – privately blamed 'fucking moaners'. All the while racking up over £30,000 in declared gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group, who were digging up the gasworks land.</p>\n\n<p>Our soon-to-be local ward councillor and (ex-)Head of Planning Peter Mason knew all about the dangers (he tells us on Twitter) from the contaminated land back in 2009 when he campaigned against its development along with our MP Virendra Sharma (who said the development would be 'a disaster environmentally').</p>\n\n<p>Yet no one told people living nearby to expect to be gassed in our own homes and gardens during the three month heatwave that was shortly to arrive.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Ealing Council announced on Twitter that the odours, while 'unpleasant', were 'not harmful to health' would be 'gone in a few days'.</p>\n\n<p>I later discovered that there is scientific evidence that some people with Asian and African heritages are genetically more vulnerable to very serious and sometimes fatal health conditions from inhaling naphthalene, a fact acknowledged (although later denied, despite the published evidence) by Public Health England at a packed public meeting in July 2019.</p>\n\n<p>No one told us.</p>\n\n<p>Ealing Council, despite being fully aware of the potential dangers to health (and to the environment) failed to carry out any kind of Equalities Impact Assessment, and only helped Berkeley Group to rush through the decontamination process to maximise their profit from Crossrail in Southall.</p>\n\n<p>Profit over people. Labour Council. Our lives didn't matter to them.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we are being asked to believe that our MP (who has begun making the right noises two years too late – what happened to the nearly 1,000 signature petition I gave you in 2018 Mr Sharma?) cares and is on our side, and that our local ward councillor cares and always has done. Only Bell is – unusually for him – honest enough not to suddenly pretend he gives a shit about anyone but himself and looking after his own family.</p>\n\n<p>At the packed public meeting in 2019, which our local ward councillor chaired, he and Bell refused to declare their financial interests with Berkeley Group, refused to let me speak with the microphone so that people couldn't hear that the Council, Berkeley Group, the Environment Agency and Public Health England had all colluded to cover up the real level of toxic and carcinogenic air pollution – that it was consistently above legal limits and rising – by manipulating, removing, and presenting the air quality data in such a way as to make it look like it was mostly within legal limits.</p>\n\n<p>At the same meeting, our MP arrived late, mostly unseen, sat silently at the back of the room, and left early, mostly unseen.\nAt the same meeting, a strangely truthful Bell admitted that he had 'known about the nuisance, the BAD nuisance, for two and a half years'! Yet nothing could be done.</p>\n\n<p>Now Peter Mason, free from his constraints as Head of Planning after resigning following his failed coup attempt to take the leadership from Bell last year, is telling us that something could and should have been done, yet all of them remained silent and did nothing for years.</p>\n\n<p>Unbelievable!</p>\n",

Firstly, he admits that people of Asian and African origin (or 'people with a Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency' as he calls them) are at risk.</p>\n    <p>Then restates his false claim that it's all about children swallowing mothballs. Or is he now referring simply to long-term health impacts in general? I've asked him for his sources, but he's on holiday now until 7 August!</p>\n    <p>The source I found is a literature review from 2013, which quite clearly talks about inhalation as the main risk (and even the single research source linked to for the genetic factor describes inhalation as the main pathway, as well as ingestion).</p>\n    <p>Then to exclude the soil hospital (which is/was always claimed to be the main source of the odour), and by which measurement PHE themselves stated that levels of naphthalene were well above legal limits and need to be 'urgently reduced' to prevent long-term exposure. Astounding!</p>\n    <p>Unroll @threadreaderapp</p>\n</div>\n",

Window frames in living room and bedroom are warped and no longer close properly after spending all summer having to open and close them repeatedly because of the awful stench, and the fear of letting toxic fumes into our home.\n\n1. Dust on windows, and car.\n\n\n1. Dust on windows, window frames no longer close properly due to opening and closing repeated due to odour and concerns about health.\n\n\n1. Walls have cracks and some things are coming out and the overall impact for the property has become very loose\n\n\n1. Windows and UVPC window frames need more frequent cleaning\n\n\n1. Cracks in the Ceiling\n\n\n1. our bath tub is green due to the continous bleach\n\n\n1. Temporary traﬃc lights on beaconsfield road made a big impact on our road and specially increase in traﬃc and digging roads(woodlands & beaconsfield) is making parking diﬃcult for us\n\n\n1. Smell and dust\n\n\n1. Cracks in walls in bedroom due to foundation shaking\n\n\n1. Cracks\n\n\n## Please describe your experience of reporting or complaining\n\n\n1. Waste of time\n\n\n1. Terrible.\n\n\n1. We have been asked to phone three separate numbers for each incident of odour nuisance and air pollution, it takes forever on the phone, no one seems to know what we are talking about, despite numerous previous complaints and reports. After all that, none of the agencies we have been told to report to actually do anything to make things better! They are useless and toothless, and Berkeley Group have treated us with utter contempt.\n\n\n1. Unsatisfactory\n\n\n1. Bad odour, have to close windows as it causes me to have a headache.\n\n\n1. Not helpful\n\n\n1. Had to close windows and doors during this very hot summer because of smell from both southall & conways double because I believe it's both places\n\n\n1. Does not seem to be an investigation into the issues raised\n\n\n1. They were not interested\n\n\n1. No positive answers or outcome.\n\n\n1. I phoned LBE Pollution Control Team.\n\n\n1. No reply\n\n\n1. No aswer back\n\n\n1. I LEFT DETAILED REPORT OF POLLUTION CAUSED AND THE ONGOING EFFECTS ON MY HEALTH AND WAS TOLD I WOULD RECEIVE A CALLBACK. I WAS CALLED BACK ONLY TO BE TOLD TO CONTACT THE GROUP UNDERTAKING THE BUILDING WORK AND RECEIVED NO OTHER HELP AT ALL.\n\n\n1. I complained about the terrible smell and horrendous amount of dust. I complained about the effect on my daughter's health.\n\n\n1. It's been diﬃcult if you ring Ealing Council they ask you to ring the Environment Agency and when you ring them they tell you to the ring the council, and vice versa, thus making you exhausted so you give up. Even if you write to them they have basically refused to take responsibility of any issues you have raised had an independent person be doing what Berkeley Group are doing they be held responsible and work stopped to establish safe levels!\n\n\n1. The smell of petrol at night preventing the openi6of windows then eye irritation all day.\n\n\n1. Has not resulted in positive outcomes\n\n\n1. No reply as of yet\n\n\n1. Very little being done.\n\n\n1. Councillors don't care and keep saying they looking into it.\n\n\n## Please describe any positive outcomes as a result of complaining or reporting\n\n19 responses\n\n\n1. None\n\n\n1. N/A\n\n\n1. Nil so far\n\n\n1. Meeting and getting to know better my neighbours.\n\n\n1. Nothing!\n\n\n1. No one from the authorities seems to care.\n\n\n1. Just take the complaint and give a reference number\n\n\n1. I don't know because council never take any suggestion with anything in the broughwith ﬂy tipping and going through things to see who is doing it so I am very disillusioned Hillingdon & All the council\n\n\n1. None\n\n\n1. The response from the Environmental Agency (North London and Hertfordshire) was somewhat dismissive. They basically said that the contractors are complying so we cant do anything.\n\n\n1. No reply - ignored\n\n\n1. Cut back foliage as requested\n\n\n1. finding others who have suffered\n\n\n1. Small measures taken by Berkely. They used more water to spray soil.\n\n\n\n\n## Do you have any suggestions for how the reporting or complaining process could be improved?\n\n14 responses\n\n\n1. There should be one reporting line, and it should be much easier to report e.g., via text, Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, or even the Ealing 24/7 app, although really that is far from ideal. The reporting needs to be public data so that everyone can see how many people have complained and what areas are affected.\n\n\n1. Feedback on what is actioned from both the council and EA\n\n\n1. Someone to action when the breach is happening. Not days after or give prior notice of site visits\n\n\n1. They should listen to us\n\n\n1. No one dose anything about no matter how many times it's reported so don't know the answer as they should have done things before they were built and never been given the go ahead\n\n\n1. Should investigate and reply to complaints\n\n\n1. physically walk into the oﬃce each time.\n\n\n1. a reply would be a good start\n\n\n1. The MP and councillors need to listed and have regular meetings with residents.\n",

But we will never know, unless we are given access to the data.\n\n\nAnd none of the above tells us what is causing the smell of petrol.\n\n\nMy gran used to mothball all her clothes, and I think I would recognise that smell. So, while I'm sure naphthalene may well be part of what we smell, it's not the whole story. And naphthalene is just fine isn't it?\n\n\nAnd then there are all the other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like xylene and toluene that they haven't mentioned. Because, we all know that sniffing an unknown, uncontrolled chemical cocktail every day for eighteen months is bound to be safe, too. It just stands to reason!\n\n",

The odours are within acceptable limits</h2>\n<p>If we can smell it, the levels must be between 2.5 parts per million and 5 parts per million (ppm) in the air. Which is way above the workplace legal limit of 1 ppm.</p>\n<p>When we met with Berkeley Group founder and chair, Tony &lsquo;Poison&rsquo; Pidgley, and his Executive Board member lapdog Karl &lsquo;Window Cleaner&rsquo; Whiteman, Karl informed us that benzene levels had averaged 3.25 ppm and never exceeded 5ppm!</p>\n<p>They will state that they are monitored on-site by &lsquo;independent&rsquo; agencies Ealing Environmental Health officers, the Environment Agency, Environ and Atkins, and all find that they are working within their legal permit.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve no doubt that is true, although we&rsquo;ve yet to see the data, despite their promises to give it to us.</p>\n<p>Are the agencies monitoring the site really independent?</p>\n<p>Ealing Council are Berkeley&rsquo;s partners in all of this, and heavily invested in seeing this project through, whatever the cost, in order to achieve their goals for building new &lsquo;affordable&rsquo;homes for Berkeley to sell to investors living in China (also, who will buy the &lsquo;unaffordable&rsquo;homes?).</p>\n<p>How else do you explain the total failure of democracy in Southall and Ealing, where almost all elected representatives have ignored and dismissed residents&rsquo; complaints,just like Berkeley,have for 16 months?</p>\n<p>Environ and Atkins are getting paid to do their &lsquo;independent&rsquo; monitoring.</p>\n<p>While we hope the Environment Agency (EA) is a truly independent monitor,every time we complain to them about the air pollution in our homes, schools, etc., they make an appointment to visit the Southall Waterside site in a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>Amazingly,they then report back that everything is fine on-site and &lsquo;within acceptable limits&rsquo;.They even say that as Berkeley keep investing in more of the totally useless (and presumably cheap) &lsquo;chocolate teapot&rsquo; odour suppressants they use, they have done &lsquo;more than could be reasonably be expected of them&rsquo;!</p>\n<p>Environmental law heavily favours Berkeley, unfortunately, and it appears there is actually very little the EA can do to stop them. Or maybe they just can&rsquo;t be bothered?</p>\n<p>And even if it is all &lsquo;within acceptable limits&rsquo;, that suggests that there are still some toxins in the air and soil.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the cleaned soil they are using to backfill the site with prior to building new homes on it, will first be covered with a &lsquo;geotextile layer&rsquo;, and then concrete, to keep the poison in.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s just lying around in huge uncovered piles, the wind blowing the dust into our homes,gardens, streets, parks, schools, workplaces or places of worship&hellip;.</p>\n<p>And no one is monitoring this at all.</p>\n<p>Strangely, the air quality monitors that were in place in Southall (including at Blair Peach Primary School) were removed in 2016,just before Berkeley Group started work&hellip;</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-the-odour-does-not-pose-a-risk-to-health\">5.

It&rsquo;s in furnishings, carpets, household cleaners, when you grill or burn food you produce benzene, it&rsquo;s in cigarette smoke.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not in our homes to such a level that we can normally smell it like we can smell the petrol odour wafting in from Southall Waterside.</p>\n<p>And, ordinarily, we&rsquo;d be able to ventilate our homes, by OPENING OUR WINDOWS! Something we are unable to do while being attacked by poison gas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-smell-a-rat\">I smell a rat!</h2>\n<p>Also reported by Mrs Puri, two dead rats were found in the nursery playground at Blair Peach.

Which is way above the workplace legal limit of 1 ppm.\n\n\nWhen we met with Berkeley Group founder and chair, Tony 'Poison' Pidgley, and his Executive Board member lapdog Karl 'Window Cleaner' Whiteman, Karl informed us that benzene levels had averaged 3.25 ppm and never exceeded 5ppm!\n\n\nThey will state that they are monitored on-site by 'independent' agencies Ealing Environmental Health officers, the Environment Agency, Environ and Atkins, and all find that they are working within their legal permit.\n\n\nI've no doubt that is true, although we've yet to see the data, despite their promises to give it to us.\n\n\nAre the agencies monitoring the site really independent?\n\n\nEaling Council are Berkeley's partners in all of this, and heavily invested in seeing this project through, whatever the cost, in order to achieve their goals for building new 'affordable'homes for Berkeley to sell to investors living in China (also, who will buy the 'unaffordable'homes?).\n\n\nHow else do you explain the total failure of democracy in Southall and Ealing, where almost all elected representatives have ignored and dismissed residents' complaints,just like Berkeley,have for 16 months?\n\n\nEnviron and Atkins are getting paid to do their 'independent' monitoring.\n\n\nWhile we hope the Environment Agency (EA) is a truly independent monitor,every time we complain to them about the air pollution in our homes, schools, etc., they make an appointment to visit the Southall Waterside site in a couple of weeks.\n\n\nAmazingly,they then report back that everything is fine on-site and 'within acceptable limits'.They even say that as Berkeley keep investing in more of the totally useless (and presumably cheap) 'chocolate teapot' odour suppressants they use, they have done 'more than could be reasonably be expected of them'!\n\n\nEnvironmental law heavily favours Berkeley, unfortunately, and it appears there is actually very little the EA can do to stop them. Or maybe they just can't be bothered?\n\n\nAnd even if it is all 'within acceptable limits', that suggests that there are still some toxins in the air and soil.\n\n\nIndeed, the cleaned soil they are using to backfill the site with prior to building new homes on it, will first be covered with a 'geotextile layer', and then concrete, to keep the poison in.\n\n\nMeanwhile, it's just lying around in huge uncovered piles, the wind blowing the dust into our homes,gardens, streets, parks, schools, workplaces or places of worship....\n\n\nAnd no one is monitoring this at all.\n\n\nStrangely, the air quality monitors that were in place in Southall (including at Blair Peach Primary School) were removed in 2016,just before Berkeley Group started work...\n\n\n## 5. The odour does not pose a risk to health\n\n\nAsk them what is causing the smell of petrol?\n\n\nThe smell of petrol is caused by benzene. (They might say it's due to other hydrocarbons. If they do ask them to specify which ones. They may say there is benzene in your home already - there is, but not so much that you can smell it!)\n\n\nBenzene causes cancer. (As do many of the other hydrocarbons.)\n\n\nThe World Health Organisation says:\n\n\n· there are no safe levels of benzene (or many of the other hydrocarbons)\n\n\n· indoor air pollution (which is not being monitored by the authorities) is worse than outdoor air pollution (because there is no wind to disperse it)\n\n\n· that children are especially vulnerable due to their small size, narrower airways, and being at key physical and cognitive developmental stages.\n\n\nThere may be other toxins in the air and dust pollution, too, for example asbestos,cyanide and arsenic.\n\n\nMany residents have complained of a whole host of symptoms that could be related to exposure to low levels of benzene over sixteen months, including:\n\n\n· Headaches\n\n\n· Eye, nose and throat irritation\n\n\n· Cough\n\n\n· Hoarse voice\n\n\n· Nausea, stomach pain and vomiting\n\n\n· Reduced appetite, fatigue or tiredness\n\n\n· Sensitisation\n\n\n· Skin rashes\n\n\n· Dizziness\n\n\n· Breathing difficulties and asthma\n\n\n· Fits or seizures\n\n\n· Miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy\n\n\n· Irritability, stress, depression and anxiety\n\n\nThe headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School reported an extremely strong smell coming from the gas works site last year, which caused headaches and asthma.\n\n\nThis was at the same meeting where she and the governors co-opted Richard Watler, Head of Construction at Southall Waterside, on to the board....\n\n\n## 6. There's benzene in your home already!\n\n\nYes, there is. It's in furnishings, carpets, household cleaners, when you grill or burn food you produce benzene, it's in cigarette smoke.\n\n\nBut it's not in our homes to such a level that we can normally smell it like we can smell the petrol odour wafting in from Southall Waterside.\n\n\nAnd, ordinarily, we'd be able to ventilate our homes, by OPENING OUR WINDOWS! Something we are unable to do while being attacked by poison gas.\n\n\n## I smell a rat!\n\n\nAlso reported by Mrs Puri, two dead rats were found in the nursery playground at Blair Peach. (Berkeley Group arranged for Rentokil to remove them, apparently!)\n\n\nWhat killed the rats?\n\n\nWhy were Berkeley Group so keen to dispose of the bodies?\n\n\nThere is long and terrible history of governments and corporations lying to the public about the safety of their products and health and safety recommendations. Here are some well known examples:\n\n\n· Tobacco\n\n\n· Asbestos\n\n\n· Dalkon Shield\n\n\n· Thalidomide\n\n\n· Corby Steel Works\n\n\n· Enfield Island Village (MoD site)\n\n\n· Grand Union Village (Taylor Woodrow site)\n\n\n· Bhopal\n\n\n· Grenfell\n\n\nI won't link to these, but encourage people to find out for themselves, and make up their own minds on whether or not to trust Berkeley Group when they tell us it's safe.\n",
