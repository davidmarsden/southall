				"content_html": "<p><em>The Children&rsquo;s Centres Crusade</em></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"chapter-1-the-art-of-political-contradiction\">Chapter 1: The Art of Political Contradiction</h2>\n<p>In the London Borough of Ealing, our elected representatives have perfected something remarkable: the ability to hold completely contradictory public positions without experiencing any apparent cognitive dissonance.</p>\n<p>Take our Council Leader. On January 15, 2015, he tweeted: <em>&ldquo;Think its really important that we put people before buildings. Important we keep activities going &amp; that can be done in a different way.&quot;</em></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Ten years later, he&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xv1ylplzzo\">closing children&rsquo;s centres</a>, buildings where people access those activities.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t hypocrisy - it&rsquo;s innovation. Why limit yourself to consistent principles when you can have all the principles, simultaneously?</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel, a parent trying to save her local children&rsquo;s centre, discovered this when she attempted to navigate Ealing&rsquo;s democratic processes. What she found was a system so logically perfect that resistance had become mathematically impossible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-2-the-democratic-möbius-strip\">Chapter 2: The Democratic Möbius Strip</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Who decides about children&rsquo;s centre closures?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked at a council meeting.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ldquo;The Cabinet,&rdquo; she was told.</p>\n<p>The Cabinet explained they were implementing officer recommendations based on budget pressures created by government policy following community consultation showing residents wanted services maintained differently.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So who can change the decision?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The decision-makers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who are the decision-makers?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The people with authority to make decisions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who has that authority?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The decision-makers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel found herself trapped in a perfectly circular system. To influence the decision, she needed to identify who made it. But everyone who appeared to make decisions claimed to be implementing someone else&rsquo;s decisions. The decision seemed to exist independently of anyone actually deciding anything.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It was like a democratic Möbius strip - no matter which direction you followed, you always ended up back where you started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-3-the-mathematics-of-progressive-budget-management\">Chapter 3: The Mathematics of Progressive Budget Management</h2>\n<p>The numbers, at least, were clear:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost of councillor allowance increases (2022-2025):</strong> Over £1 million</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/3-ealing-childrens-centres-saved-31844687\">Savings</a> from closing children&rsquo;s centres:</strong> £750,000</li>\n<li><strong>Council Leader&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://ealing.news/ealing-council/ealing-council-leader-peter-mason-massive-allowance-rise-by-over-70-along-with-increases-for-his-cabinet/\">pay rise</a>:</strong> 70%</li>\n<li><strong>Number of children&rsquo;s centres being closed in Southall:</strong> 3 out of 6</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Council Leader had discovered something revolutionary: you could simultaneously claim budget constraints while voting yourself substantial pay rises. The secret was treating these as completely unrelated mathematical operations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have to make difficult decisions due to budget pressures,&rdquo; he explained, while awarding himself £58,000 annually.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But you spent more on pay rises than you&rsquo;re saving,&rdquo; Mrs. Patel pointed out.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different budget.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same money.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand local government finance. And we need <a href=\"https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&amp;spage=common/eacouncil220.htm\">higher calibre</a> councillor candidates.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-4-environmental-priorities---a-scientific-approach\">Chapter 4: Environmental Priorities - A Scientific Approach</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader&rsquo;s environmental consciousness follows a precise hierarchy, documented through his public responses:</p>\n<p><strong>Tier 1 Emergency Response:</strong> Eels gasping in the River Brent receive <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18312/to_thames_water_-_sewage_entering_into_the_river_brent.pdf\">immediate action</a> [pdf) and public concern.</p>\n<p><strong>Tier 2 Public Complaint:</strong> Someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;bag and/or small child&rdquo; taking up a tube seat merits a public tweet about &ldquo;Some people.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><strong>Tier 3 Busy Schedule:</strong> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xA4mI_OAzxs\">Children gasping from toxic air</a> [YouTube] in bedrooms get told &quot; <a href=\"https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxCUBKF53mk-J0KrZ4bxXaoAxc9iVEQhN-\">I&rsquo;m very busy.</a>&rdquo; [YouTube)]</p>\n<p>When five-year-old Zion asked him directly, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/w-p6qy2RfR8\">Peter, why didn&rsquo;t you help us?</a>&rdquo; [YouTube] about the gasworks poisoning, the response was so technical that Zion said it was &ldquo;too sciencey&rdquo; to understand.</p>\n<p>This established a clear principle: if environmental concerns can&rsquo;t be explained to five-year-olds, they&rsquo;re probably too complex for five-year-olds to experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-5-the-southall-paradox\">Chapter 5: The Southall Paradox</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Only in Southall can carcinogenic benzene, and naphthalene - which is known to be potentially <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3850774/\">fatal to some people with African and Asian heritage</a> - be released into the air from the Gasworks development at levels way <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CGGyCDAHRt4?si=OtAGYXGA2CQ1y3q5&amp;utm_source=MTQxZ\">above legal limits</a> and be simultaneously &ldquo;not hazardous&rdquo; according to Ealing Council.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>One moment the Headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School is <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hB66yX40-q-YYi6EKOTvE20DTx422_g3/view?usp=drivesdk\">reporting asthma and headaches</a> [p. 10] caused by very strong smells from the Gasworks site; in another moment, the developer&rsquo;s head of construction is appointed to the school&rsquo;s board of governors [pp. 7-8] and arranges to remove dead rats from the nursery playground [p. 11]. These events are clearly unconnected.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s all perfectly normal in Southall, where <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/cleanair-for-southall-and-hayes-stop-berkeleygroupuk-s-southallwaterside-polluting-our-kids-southalllivesmatter/u/23019750\">kids can be locked in class without ventilation on hot days</a> to protect them from the harmless petrol odour, and the developer&rsquo;s &ldquo;community liaison officer&rdquo; can <a href=\"https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1926034207492407709\">simultaneously</a> be the chair of Southall&rsquo;s charity umbrella organisation, an ex-Tory tobacco salesman whose former employer <a href=\"https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1630863285892333569\">paid for our ex-MP&rsquo;s research assistant</a> to attend a jolly. Nothing to see here!</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get even more interesting. The Council&rsquo;s own &ldquo;<a href=\"https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s1726/Southall%20Reset.pdf\">Southall Reset</a>&rdquo; [pdf] document acknowledges that &ldquo;challenges of deprivation, low pay, are particularly acute&rdquo; in Southall, contributing to &ldquo;deeply embedded health and wellbeing challenges.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Race Equality Commission Report &ldquo;highlighted the need for an investment in adequate primary care in Southall&rdquo; and &ldquo;deeper meaningful engagement, and better conversations with residents.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Council&rsquo;s response to this need for MORE investment? Close children&rsquo;s centres.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So you know we need MORE investment?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. The evidence is clear,&rdquo; they said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Then why are you closing children&rsquo;s centres?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Budget pressures.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But your own report says we need more investment, not less.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different report.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your report. You wrote it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Different department.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Same council.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Different budget.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Same money.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand local government.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. They could officially acknowledge that Southall needed more investment while simultaneously cutting investment. They could document the problem and implement policies that made it worse. Each document existed in its own logical universe, disconnected from actual decisions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-6-the-mipim-negotiations\">Chapter 6: The MIPIM Negotiations</h2>\n<p>Every year, the Council Leader attends MIPIM in Cannes - what Private Eye calls a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://stopthetowers.info/the-mipim-jolly\">booze &lsquo;n&rsquo; hookerfest</a>&rdquo; - with expenses paid by Berkeley Group, the company behind the gasworks development that&rsquo;s been poisoning Southall residents.</p>\n<p>He goes to &ldquo;negotiate hard&rdquo; with developers.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The documented results of these negotiations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More developments approved</li>\n<li>Continued toxic air from gasworks</li>\n<li>Larger councillor allowances</li>\n<li>Closure of community facilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Either he&rsquo;s a remarkably poor negotiator, or &ldquo;negotiating hard&rdquo; means something different in Cannes than it does in English.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-7-the-zionist-anti-zionist-synthesis\">Chapter 7: The Zionist-Anti-Zionist Synthesis</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader represents Southall Green - 69% BAME, one of the most ethnically diverse wards in Britain. Many of his constituents have strong views about Palestinian liberation.</p>\n<p>His attitude? &ldquo;People who commit themselves to being opposed to Jewish national self determination / liberation aren&rsquo;t my cup of tea. They can exist, sure, just outside of the Labour movement.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So he simultaneously represents a diverse community while working to exclude people from that community based on their views about Middle Eastern politics.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a masterclass in representation: represent everyone, except the people whose politics you disagree with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-8-the-protection-by-destruction-innovation\">Chapter 8: The Protection-by-Destruction Innovation</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader has pioneered a new approach to public service: protecting things by eliminating them.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Govt Commissioners to slash and burn services,&rdquo; he explains, while slashing and burning services.</p>\n<p>It was like watching someone slash the low-hanging fruit on the trees and then set fire to the orchard; then selling the &ldquo;infertile land&rdquo; to developers when there&rsquo;s nothing to eat.</p>\n<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t even the worst part. Mrs. Patel had discovered something even more troubling. Back in 2012, a group of unelected businessmen had met to play <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W2HRPD00OiidxP9iAlLPDFHPVwZcEfeM/view?usp=drivesdk\">Monopoly</a> [pdf] with public assets. Not the board game - though the principle was identical. They wanted to &ldquo;sell off our public assets for £20m profit.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Their target included &ldquo;buildings used for services for vulnerable adults, children and families.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So they planned this years ago?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked the councillor.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about that,&rdquo; the councillor said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re closing children&rsquo;s centres,&rdquo; Mrs. Patel said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting services by cutting them,&rdquo; they explained patiently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Government Commissioners to slash and burn services.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But you ARE slashing and burning services.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting them by cutting them responsibly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How is closing them protecting them?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t close them, someone else will close them worse.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>&ldquo;The Government Commissioners.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Have they said they&rsquo;ll close them?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re closing them to prevent them being closed?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting them by cutting them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Round and round she went, trapped in a perfectly logical system designed to make resistance impossible.</p>\n<p>The beautiful thing was that everyone was telling the truth. The councillor really didn&rsquo;t know about the 2012 meeting. The 2012 meeting really had happened. The plan really was being implemented. Nobody was really in charge of implementing it.</p>\n<p>Somehow, a decision made by people who didn&rsquo;t officially exist was being executed by people who officially couldn&rsquo;t stop it.\nThis allows him to be simultaneously the protector of services and the person closing services - a remarkable administrative innovation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-9-democracy-20---now-with-less-democracy\">Chapter 9: Democracy 2.0 - Now With Less Democracy</h2>\n<p>But the system&rsquo;s crowning achievement is happening right now. <strong>This month - July 2025 - Ealing Council is rewriting the petition rules</strong> in direct response to successful community campaigns.</p>\n<p>On page 294 of their July 15, 2025 council <a href=\"https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g6611/Public%20reports%20pack%20Tuesday%2015-Jul-2025%2019.00%20Council.pdf?T=10\">papers</a> [pdf, see p. 294], you can see democracy being crossed out in real time. They&rsquo;re removing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Residents' rights to ask follow-up questions</li>\n<li>Requirements for senior officers to give evidence</li>\n<li>Meaningful participation in debates about their own petitions</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>They&rsquo;ve solved the democracy problem by removing the democratic bits from democracy.</p>\n<p>The timing is perfect: after communities proved they could win by building independent pressure (Save Southall Young Adult Centre, Save Southall Town Hall, Save Warren Farm Nature Reserve), the council is changing the rules to prevent it happening again.</p>\n<p>Soon residents will be able to petition - they just won&rsquo;t be able to ask questions, get answers, or participate in discussions about their concerns.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s democracy in name only, which is much more efficient than the old democracy where people could actually influence things.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-10-the-southall-young-adult-centre-miracle\">Chapter 10: The Southall Young Adult Centre Miracle</h2>\n<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing - resistance is still possible. In 2022, the Council wanted to demolish Southall Young Adult Centre to build 60 flats. The usual process commenced: consultation theater, predetermined decisions, official helplessness.</p>\n<p>Then the &ldquo;Save Southall Young Adult Centre&rdquo; campaign launched. They didn&rsquo;t try to work within the impossible system. They built independent pressure. They refused to accept that &ldquo;decisions had been made.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>They <a href=\"https://www.visitsouthall.co.uk/News/NewsDetails.php?recordID=1235\">won</a>.</p>\n<p>The centre was saved.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We stopped playing by their rules,&rdquo; the organisers said. &ldquo;We built power they couldn&rsquo;t ignore.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-11-the-impossible-solution\">Chapter 11: The Impossible Solution</h2>\n<p>Mrs. Patel realized the children&rsquo;s centres could be saved the same way. But it would require doing something the system said was impossible: organising outside the official channels, building independent power, refusing to accept predetermined outcomes.</p>\n<p>The Council had just changed the petition rules specifically to prevent another people-powered victory. But that only proved they were afraid of effective organising.</p>\n<p>The system&rsquo;s weakness was its strength: it was so obviously absurd that anyone paying attention could see through it.</p>\n<p>The Council Leader could tweet about putting &ldquo;people before buildings&rdquo; while closing buildings where people accessed services. He could claim to protect services while cutting them. He could represent diverse communities while excluding their political views. He could prioritize eels over children and call it environmentalism.</p>\n<p>All of this was only possible because residents had been playing by rules designed to make them lose.</p>\n<p>But the campaigns to save the Young Adult Centre, the Town Hall and Warren Farm proved the rules could be broken.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-12-the-choice\">Chapter 12: The Choice</h2>\n<p>Mrs. Patel had a choice. She could continue navigating the impossible bureaucracy, filing petitions that couldn&rsquo;t ask questions, attending consultations about predetermined decisions, lobbying councillors who claimed to have no power.</p>\n<p>Or she could do what the other campaigners did: build independent power and refuse to accept defeat.</p>\n<p>The children&rsquo;s centres could be saved. But only if parents stopped trying to reason with an unreasonable system and started building the power to change it.</p>\n<p>The Council Leader would continue inhabiting his world of simultaneous contradictions, where closing centres meant protecting them and cutting services meant investing in communities.</p>\n<p>But Mrs. Patel had learned something important: impossible things happen every day in Ealing politics.</p>\n<p>If the Council Leader could be simultaneously progressive and regressive, protective and destructive, representative and exclusionary, then maybe Mrs. Patel could do something equally impossible.</p>\n<p>Like save a children&rsquo;s centre.</p>\n<p>The Young Adult Centre campaigners had already shown it could be done.</p>\n<p>Now it was the children&rsquo;s centres' turn.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Even this right wing authoritarian Labour government thinks it&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvj1jr0kz0o\">bad idea</a> to close children&rsquo;s centres.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-13-the-engagement-paradox\">Chapter 13: The Engagement Paradox</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader had perfected the art of simultaneous engagement.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>He could tweet about &ldquo;absolutely committed to engaging, listening and compromising&rdquo; while sharing photos of residents protesting his refusal to engage, listen, or compromise.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>He spoke frequently about &ldquo;transparent engagement&rdquo; and &ldquo;finding the compromises everyone needs to make&rdquo; - usually while explaining why the compromises residents needed to make were accepting whatever he&rsquo;d already decided.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Even councillors who were &ldquo;most responsive&rdquo; resigned rather than &ldquo;effectively endorse his toxic brand of politics.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But the real innovation was tweeting &ldquo;Welcome to Dystopia&rdquo; while creating it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"chapter-14-the-investment-paradox\">Chapter 14: The Investment Paradox</h2>\n<p>The Council Leader had achieved something remarkable: he could simultaneously remember genocide while investing in it. &ldquo;Remember Yesterday, Act Today,&rdquo; his council posted about the genocide of 8,732 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica thirty years ago, while <a href=\"https://lgpsdivest.org/lgps-investments/\">investing £112 million</a> in companies enabling genocide of <a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/news/2025/05/un-women-estimates-over-28000-women-and-girls-killed-in-gaza-since-october-2023\">more than 28,000 women and girls</a> in Gaza today. <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unimaginable-horrors-more-50000-children-reportedly-killed-or-injured-gaza-strip\">More than 50,000 children killed or injured</a> in Gaza to pay for his pension.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It was beautifully efficient. Why limit yourself to one genocide when you could remember one while funding another? The children understood perfectly.</p>\n<p>Equally impressive was his ability to close children&rsquo;s centres for budget reasons while sitting on the board as a <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/opdc_2020.21_audited_annual_report_and_accounts.pdf\">paid director</a> [pdf] of a corporation that had just received £140 million in public funding. The logic was flawless: children&rsquo;s services were unaffordable, but corporate development was essential.</p>\n<p>The Council Leader had mastered the art of proportional response. Children&rsquo;s centres closing to save £750,000? Budget pressures, difficult decisions, no choice. Sitting on the board overseeing &ldquo;one of the biggest regeneration schemes in Europe&rdquo; with £140 million in funding? That was worth £2,000 a year of his valuable time.</p>\n<p>It was a masterclass in priorities: Europe&rsquo;s biggest regeneration project required his oversight, but Southall&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s centres were an unaffordable luxury.</p>\n<p>He could simultaneously claim there was no money for community services while helping to plan a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/fresh-pictures-reveal-what-london-22320564\">mini-Manhattan</a>&rdquo; in his own borough. The vision was clear: 54-storey towers, yes. Children&rsquo;s centres, no.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;d found the perfect balance: cut services locally to save money, earn money regionally to oversee developers' profits. It was like a perpetual motion machine of fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-and-verse-the-evolution-of-enlightenment\">Chapter and Verse: The Evolution of Enlightenment</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In 2010, our future Council Leader shared his frustration about &ldquo;sitting around not understanding all this punjabi&rdquo; at community meetings in the area he would later represent.</p>\n<p>By 2020, he had evolved. &ldquo;Words have consequences,&rdquo; he tweeted. &ldquo;Impact is as important as intent. Culture is defined by leadership.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Ten years of personal growth had taught him that words matter. Which made it remarkable that he could simultaneously lecture about cultural sensitivity while closing community centres in the same diverse communities he&rsquo;d once struggled to understand. It was a masterclass in progressive evolution: you could acknowledge that words have consequences while ensuring your own words from the past had none.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>Readers who think this is all a bit unfair, unbelievable, unhelpful or downright unlawful&hellip;</p>\n<p>The most revealing evidence of how the system works came from inside the machine itself. In 2022, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hZfSB-RR7OzeCIHclKdiJd_FTnUtT7KA/view?usp=drivesdk\">leaked WhatsApp messages</a> [pdf] from the Ealing Labour councillors' group chat revealed what they really thought about their leadership.</p>\n<p>Mason&rsquo;s own Labour colleagues called the Council Leader &ldquo;callous, ruthless, sectarian.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>They discussed votes of no confidence, referenced &ldquo;corruption and even theft&rdquo; regarding the previous leader, and debated &ldquo;bribes&rdquo; and &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; for loyalty. Meanwhile, publicly, they maintained perfect unity and collective responsibility. It was the perfect illustration of how the system works: private recognition of the problems, public performance of harmony.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Patel understood perfectly. The same councillors who privately criticised authoritarian leadership accepted Mason&rsquo;s cabinet positions and pay rises to sit in silent support during council meetings.The leaked messages proved Mrs. Patel wasn&rsquo;t imagining the contradictions - even the people inside the system could see them. They just couldn&rsquo;t say so publicly.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>URGENT support to fund a <a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-ealings-childrens-centres/\">legal challenge</a> to Ealing Council&rsquo;s decision to close 10 children&rsquo;s centres.</p>\n<p><em>Sources: All tweets, council documents, and quotes are publicly available and linked in the original post at <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local.html\">https://davidmarsden.info/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local.html</a></em></p>\n<p>Try your hand at <a href=\"https://ealing.netlify.app/interactive.html\">democracy in Ealing</a> with our fun interactive FAQs, budget calculator and decision-making process explainer!</p>\n<p><em>Related reading: <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2019/08/25/southall-under-siege.html\">Southall Under Siege</a> | <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2022/12/16/the-property-lobby.html\">The Property Lobby</a> | <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2023/01/16/air-quality-strategy.html\">Air Quality Strategy Response</a> | <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2025/03/09/save-ealings-childrens-centres.html\">Action you can take</a> | <a href=\"https://davidmarsden.info/2025/03/12/ealing-council-are-consulting-on.html\">Think of the children</a> | <a href=\"https://saveealingchildrenscentres.wordpress.com/\">Save Ealing Children&rsquo;s Centres (official campaign website)</a></em></p>\n",

On January 15, 2015, he tweeted: *\"Think its really important that we put people before buildings. Important we keep activities going & that can be done in a different way.\"*\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/fc83f238fa.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason emphasizes prioritizing people over buildings and discusses Ealing Council's community centers at a committee meeting.\">\n\n\nTen years later, he's [closing children's centres](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xv1ylplzzo), buildings where people access those activities.\n\n\nThis isn't hypocrisy - it's innovation. Why limit yourself to consistent principles when you can have all the principles, simultaneously?\n\n\nMrs. Patel, a parent trying to save her local children's centre, discovered this when she attempted to navigate Ealing's democratic processes. What she found was a system so logically perfect that resistance had become mathematically impossible.\n\n\n## Chapter 2: The Democratic Möbius Strip\n\n\n\"Who decides about children's centre closures?\" Mrs. Patel asked at a council meeting.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/98e8dd79de.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two men are discussing next to an illuminated architectural model, with a display board about Ealing's short-term vision in the background.\">\n\n\n\"The Cabinet,\" she was told.\n\n\nThe Cabinet explained they were implementing officer recommendations based on budget pressures created by government policy following community consultation showing residents wanted services maintained differently.\n\n\n\"So who can change the decision?\"\n\n\n\"The decision-makers.\"\n\n\n\"Who are the decision-makers?\"\n\n\n\"The people with authority to make decisions.\"\n\n\n\"Who has that authority?\"\n\n\n\"The decision-makers.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel found herself trapped in a perfectly circular system. To influence the decision, she needed to identify who made it. But everyone who appeared to make decisions claimed to be implementing someone else's decisions. The decision seemed to exist independently of anyone actually deciding anything.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/0be5b8f75d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Möbius strip, shown with a twist and a small person observing, illustrates its unique one-sided property.\">\nImage: Jono Hey, [Sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/mobius-strip)\n\n\nIt was like a democratic Möbius strip - no matter which direction you followed, you always ended up back where you started.\n\n\n## Chapter 3: The Mathematics of Progressive Budget Management\n\n\nThe numbers, at least, were clear:\n\n\n- **Cost of councillor allowance increases (2022-2025):** Over £1 million\n- **[Savings](https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/3-ealing-childrens-centres-saved-31844687) from closing children's centres:** £750,000\n- **Council Leader's [pay rise](https://ealing.news/ealing-council/ealing-council-leader-peter-mason-massive-allowance-rise-by-over-70-along-with-increases-for-his-cabinet/):** 70%\n- **Number of children's centres being closed in Southall:** 3 out of 6\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7bb908e3f4.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"778\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A group of people are holding signs in a protest, with one reading KIDS OUT! Someone has to pay for my 70% pay rise and another reading NO MORE PLAY SCHOOL!.\">\n\n\nThe Council Leader had discovered something revolutionary: you could simultaneously claim budget constraints while voting yourself substantial pay rises. The secret was treating these as completely unrelated mathematical operations.\n\n\n\"We have to make difficult decisions due to budget pressures,\" he explained, while awarding himself £58,000 annually.\n\n\n\"But you spent more on pay rises than you're saving,\" Mrs. Patel pointed out.\n\n\n\"That's a different budget.\"\n\n\n\"It's the same money.\"\n\n\n\"You don't understand local government finance. And we need [higher calibre](https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&spage=common/eacouncil220.htm) councillor candidates.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly.\n\n\n## Chapter 4: Environmental Priorities - A Scientific Approach\n\n\nThe Council Leader's environmental consciousness follows a precise hierarchy, documented through his public responses:\n\n\n**Tier 1 Emergency Response:** Eels gasping in the River Brent receive [immediate action](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18312/to_thames_water_-_sewage_entering_into_the_river_brent.pdf) [pdf) and public concern.\n\n\n**Tier 2 Public Complaint:** Someone's \"bag and/or small child\" taking up a tube seat merits a public tweet about \"Some people.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/c0020bb277.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"253\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Peter Mason tweets about taking the tube instead of cycling and needing someone to move their bag or child for him to sit.\">\n\n\n**Tier 3 Busy Schedule:** [Children gasping from toxic air](https://youtu.be/xA4mI_OAzxs) [YouTube] in bedrooms get told \" [I'm very busy.](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxCUBKF53mk-J0KrZ4bxXaoAxc9iVEQhN-)\" [YouTube)]\n\n\nWhen five-year-old Zion asked him directly, \"[Peter, why didn't you help us?](https://youtu.be/w-p6qy2RfR8)\" [YouTube] about the gasworks poisoning, the response was so technical that Zion said it was \"too sciencey\" to understand.\n\n\nThis established a clear principle: if environmental concerns can't be explained to five-year-olds, they're probably too complex for five-year-olds to experience.\n\n\n## Chapter 5: The Southall Paradox\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/74597bfcfb.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"224\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A bar graph compares the concentrations of various toxic hydrocarbons from Southall Old Gasworks Soil Hospital across different monitoring periods in 2018 and 2019, highlighting levels of Benzene, Naphthalene, Toluene, Xylene, Trimethylbenzenes, and 4-Iso-propyltoluene with legal limits indicated for Benzene and Naphthalene.\">\n\n\nOnly in Southall can carcinogenic benzene, and naphthalene - which is known to be potentially [fatal to some people with African and Asian heritage](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3850774/) - be released into the air from the Gasworks development at levels way [above legal limits](https://youtu.be/CGGyCDAHRt4?si=OtAGYXGA2CQ1y3q5&utm_source=MTQxZ) and be simultaneously \"not hazardous\" according to Ealing Council. \n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/6624f74972.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"254\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Ealing Council tweets that they are monitoring reports of strong odours at a Berkeley Group construction site in Southall Gasworks, assuring the odours aren't hazardous and should clear in a few days.\">\n\n\nOne moment the Headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School is [reporting asthma and headaches](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hB66yX40-q-YYi6EKOTvE20DTx422_g3/view?usp=drivesdk) [p. 10] caused by very strong smells from the Gasworks site; in another moment, the developer's head of construction is appointed to the school's board of governors [pp. 7-8] and arranges to remove dead rats from the nursery playground [p. 11]. These events are clearly unconnected.\n\n\nIt's all perfectly normal in Southall, where [kids can be locked in class without ventilation on hot days](https://www.change.org/p/cleanair-for-southall-and-hayes-stop-berkeleygroupuk-s-southallwaterside-polluting-our-kids-southalllivesmatter/u/23019750) to protect them from the harmless petrol odour, and the developer's \"community liaison officer\" can [simultaneously](https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1926034207492407709) be the chair of Southall's charity umbrella organisation, an ex-Tory tobacco salesman whose former employer [paid for our ex-MP's research assistant](https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1630863285892333569) to attend a jolly. Nothing to see here!\n\n\nHere's where things get even more interesting. The Council's own \"[Southall Reset](https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s1726/Southall%20Reset.pdf)\" [pdf] document acknowledges that \"challenges of deprivation, low pay, are particularly acute\" in Southall, contributing to \"deeply embedded health and wellbeing challenges.\" \n\n\nThe Race Equality Commission Report \"highlighted the need for an investment in adequate primary care in Southall\" and \"deeper meaningful engagement, and better conversations with residents.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/6d6e997a4e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"143\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Challenges in Southall include deprivation, low pay, and the need for improved primary care and community engagement.\">\n\n\nThe Council's response to this need for MORE investment? Close children's centres.\n\n\n\"So you know we need MORE investment?\" Mrs. Patel asked.\n\n\n\"Absolutely. The evidence is clear,\" they said.\n\n\n\"Then why are you closing children's centres?\"\n\n\n\"Budget pressures.\"\n\n\n\"But your own report says we need more investment, not less.\"\n\n\n\"That's a different report.\"\n\n\n\"It's your report. You wrote it.\"\n\n\n\"Different department.\"\n\n\n\"Same council.\"\n\n\n\"Different budget.\"\n\n\n\"Same money.\"\n\n\n\"You don't understand local government.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. They could officially acknowledge that Southall needed more investment while simultaneously cutting investment. They could document the problem and implement policies that made it worse. Each document existed in its own logical universe, disconnected from actual decisions.\n\n\n## Chapter 6: The MIPIM Negotiations\n\n\nEvery year, the Council Leader attends MIPIM in Cannes - what Private Eye calls a \"[booze 'n' hookerfest](https://stopthetowers.info/the-mipim-jolly)\" - with expenses paid by Berkeley Group, the company behind the gasworks development that's been poisoning Southall residents.\n\n\nHe goes to \"negotiate hard\" with developers.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/cac51e7bb8.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"650\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses negotiating for genuinely affordable homes at MIPIM, contrasting it with the idea of it being a holiday.\">\n\n\nThe documented results of these negotiations:\n- More developments approved\n- Continued toxic air from gasworks\n- Larger councillor allowances\n- Closure of community facilities\n\n\nEither he's a remarkably poor negotiator, or \"negotiating hard\" means something different in Cannes than it does in English.\n\n\n## Chapter 7: The Zionist-Anti-Zionist Synthesis \n\n\nThe Council Leader represents Southall Green - 69% BAME, one of the most ethnically diverse wards in Britain. Many of his constituents have strong views about Palestinian liberation.\n\n\nHis attitude? \"People who commit themselves to being opposed to Jewish national self determination / liberation aren't my cup of tea. They can exist, sure, just outside of the Labour movement.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/160bd2a958.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"382\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person shares their perspective on anti-Zionism and Jewish national self-determination in a social media post.\">\n\n\nSo he simultaneously represents a diverse community while working to exclude people from that community based on their views about Middle Eastern politics.\n\n\nIt's a masterclass in representation: represent everyone, except the people whose politics you disagree with.\n\n\n## Chapter 8: The Protection-by-Destruction Innovation\n\n\nThe Council Leader has pioneered a new approach to public service: protecting things by eliminating them.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/c19f8ce2da.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"356\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason responds to Tom Gann, defending a decision to protect frontline services instead of cutting them.\">\n\n\n\"We've made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Govt Commissioners to slash and burn services,\" he explains, while slashing and burning services.\n\n\nIt was like watching someone slash the low-hanging fruit on the trees and then set fire to the orchard; then selling the \"infertile land\" to developers when there's nothing to eat.\n\n\nBut that wasn't even the worst part. Mrs. Patel had discovered something even more troubling. Back in 2012, a group of unelected businessmen had met to play [Monopoly](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W2HRPD00OiidxP9iAlLPDFHPVwZcEfeM/view?usp=drivesdk) [pdf] with public assets. Not the board game - though the principle was identical. They wanted to \"sell off our public assets for £20m profit.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/deb63dd611.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"703\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Monopoly game board is shown with green houses scattered on the board and the surrounding table.\">\n\n\nTheir target included \"buildings used for services for vulnerable adults, children and families.\"\n\n\n\"So they planned this years ago?\" Mrs. Patel asked the councillor.\n\n\n\"I wouldn't know anything about that,\" the councillor said.\n\n\n\"But you're closing children's centres,\" Mrs. Patel said.\n\n\n\"We're protecting services by cutting them,\" they explained patiently. \"We've made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Government Commissioners to slash and burn services.\"\n\n\n\"But you ARE slashing and burning services.\"\n\n\n\"We're protecting them by cutting them responsibly.\"\n\n\n\"How is closing them protecting them?\"\n\n\n\"If we don't close them, someone else will close them worse.\"\n\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f5fcab7334.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"365\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses the importance of members shaping manifestos and taking responsibility for decisions, emphasizing the role of residents.\">\n\n\n\"The Government Commissioners.\"\n\n\n\"Have they said they'll close them?\"\n\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\n\"So you're closing them to prevent them being closed?\"\n\n\n\"We're protecting them by cutting them.\"\n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Round and round she went, trapped in a perfectly logical system designed to make resistance impossible.\n\n\nThe beautiful thing was that everyone was telling the truth. The councillor really didn't know about the 2012 meeting. The 2012 meeting really had happened. The plan really was being implemented. Nobody was really in charge of implementing it.\n\n\nSomehow, a decision made by people who didn't officially exist was being executed by people who officially couldn't stop it.\nThis allows him to be simultaneously the protector of services and the person closing services - a remarkable administrative innovation.\n\n\n## Chapter 9: Democracy 2.0 - Now With Less Democracy\n\n\nBut the system's crowning achievement is happening right now. **This month - July 2025 - Ealing Council is rewriting the petition rules** in direct response to successful community campaigns.\n\n\nOn page 294 of their July 15, 2025 council [papers](https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g6611/Public%20reports%20pack%20Tuesday%2015-Jul-2025%2019.00%20Council.pdf?T=10) [pdf, see p. 294], you can see democracy being crossed out in real time. They're removing:\n- Residents' rights to ask follow-up questions\n- Requirements for senior officers to give evidence  \n- Meaningful participation in debates about their own petitions\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/8439aacef6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"347\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: The document contains redlined text showing revisions related to the procedures for responding to petitions and presenting debates before the Council.\">\n\n\nThey've solved the democracy problem by removing the democratic bits from democracy. \n\n\nThe timing is perfect: after communities proved they could win by building independent pressure (Save Southall Young Adult Centre, Save Southall Town Hall, Save Warren Farm Nature Reserve), the council is changing the rules to prevent it happening again.\n\n\nSoon residents will be able to petition - they just won't be able to ask questions, get answers, or participate in discussions about their concerns.\n\n\nIt's democracy in name only, which is much more efficient than the old democracy where people could actually influence things.\n\n\n## Chapter 10: The Southall Young Adult Centre Miracle\n\n\nBut here's the thing - resistance is still possible. In 2022, the Council wanted to demolish Southall Young Adult Centre to build 60 flats. The usual process commenced: consultation theater, predetermined decisions, official helplessness.\n\n\nThen the \"Save Southall Young Adult Centre\" campaign launched. They didn't try to work within the impossible system. They built independent pressure. They refused to accept that \"decisions had been made.\"\n\n\nThey [won](https://www.visitsouthall.co.uk/News/NewsDetails.php?recordID=1235).\n\n\nThe centre was saved.\n\n\n\"How?\" Mrs. Patel asked.\n\n\n\"We stopped playing by their rules,\" the organisers said. \"We built power they couldn't ignore.\"\n\n\n## Chapter 11: The Impossible Solution\n\n\nMrs. Patel realized the children's centres could be saved the same way. But it would require doing something the system said was impossible: organising outside the official channels, building independent power, refusing to accept predetermined outcomes.\n\n\nThe Council had just changed the petition rules specifically to prevent another people-powered victory. But that only proved they were afraid of effective organising.\n\n\nThe system's weakness was its strength: it was so obviously absurd that anyone paying attention could see through it.\n\n\nThe Council Leader could tweet about putting \"people before buildings\" while closing buildings where people accessed services. He could claim to protect services while cutting them. He could represent diverse communities while excluding their political views. He could prioritize eels over children and call it environmentalism.\n\n\nAll of this was only possible because residents had been playing by rules designed to make them lose.\n\n\nBut the campaigns to save the Young Adult Centre, the Town Hall and Warren Farm proved the rules could be broken.\n\n\n## Chapter 12: The Choice\n\n\nMrs. Patel had a choice. She could continue navigating the impossible bureaucracy, filing petitions that couldn't ask questions, attending consultations about predetermined decisions, lobbying councillors who claimed to have no power.\n\n\nOr she could do what the other campaigners did: build independent power and refuse to accept defeat.\n\n\nThe children's centres could be saved. But only if parents stopped trying to reason with an unreasonable system and started building the power to change it.\n\n\nThe Council Leader would continue inhabiting his world of simultaneous contradictions, where closing centres meant protecting them and cutting services meant investing in communities.\n\n\nBut Mrs. Patel had learned something important: impossible things happen every day in Ealing politics.\n\n\nIf the Council Leader could be simultaneously progressive and regressive, protective and destructive, representative and exclusionary, then maybe Mrs. Patel could do something equally impossible.\n\n\nLike save a children's centre. \n\n\nThe Young Adult Centre campaigners had already shown it could be done.\n\n\nNow it was the children's centres' turn. \n\n\nMrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Even this right wing authoritarian Labour government thinks it's a [bad idea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvj1jr0kz0o) to close children's centres. \n\n## Chapter 13: The Engagement Paradox  \n\nThe Council Leader had perfected the art of simultaneous engagement.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b26d191a08.jpg\" width=\"496\" height=\"499\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A group of people holding protest signs gathers at night, with a tweet from Peter Mason about planning rules and community engagement.\">  \n\nHe could tweet about \"absolutely committed to engaging, listening and compromising\" while sharing photos of residents protesting his refusal to engage, listen, or compromise.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/117ce072a1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1020\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: Two social media posts promote a webinar and report launch about public engagement and planning for the future, by inviting people to join discussions on connected platforms.\">  \n\nHe spoke frequently about \"transparent engagement\" and \"finding the compromises everyone needs to make\" - usually while explaining why the compromises residents needed to make were accepting whatever he'd already decided.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/10069a5050.jpg\" width=\"496\" height=\"386\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet mentions a public meeting about Ealing's Local Plan, focusing on growth, priorities, challenges, and future planning.\">  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7e95b424b9.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"474\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses the goal of campaigning and highlights that Twitter is often a zero-sum game.\">\n\nEven councillors who were \"most responsive\" resigned rather than \"effectively endorse his toxic brand of politics.\"  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/76b65af2ac.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"565\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet expresses disappointment over a local councillor's resignation due to opposition to a colleague's political approach.\">  \n\nBut the real innovation was tweeting \"Welcome to Dystopia\" while creating it.  \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/4264ddab3e.jpg\" width=\"496\" height=\"624\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A tweet by Peter Mason discusses the limits of conservative populism and the exploitation of rhetoric, with a highlighted quote on the consequences for demagogues.\">  \n\n## Chapter 14: The Investment Paradox \n\n\nThe Council Leader had achieved something remarkable: he could simultaneously remember genocide while investing in it. \"Remember Yesterday, Act Today,\" his council posted about the genocide of 8,732 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica thirty years ago, while [investing £112 million](https://lgpsdivest.org/lgps-investments/) in companies enabling genocide of [more than 28,000 women and girls](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/news/2025/05/un-women-estimates-over-28000-women-and-girls-killed-in-gaza-since-october-2023) in Gaza today. [More than 50,000 children killed or injured](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unimaginable-horrors-more-50000-children-reportedly-killed-or-injured-gaza-strip) in Gaza to pay for his pension. \n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/d7a8763427.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"822\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: White tombstones in a cemetery are shown in a tweet about Srebrenica Memorial Day, which marks the genocide's 30th anniversary.\">\n\nIt was beautifully efficient. Why limit yourself to one genocide when you could remember one while funding another? The children understood perfectly.\n\n\nEqually impressive was his ability to close children's centres for budget reasons while sitting on the board as a [paid director](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/opdc_2020.21_audited_annual_report_and_accounts.pdf) [pdf] of a corporation that had just received £140 million in public funding. The logic was flawless: children's services were unaffordable, but corporate development was essential.\n\n\nThe Council Leader had mastered the art of proportional response. Children's centres closing to save £750,000? Budget pressures, difficult decisions, no choice. Sitting on the board overseeing \"one of the biggest regeneration schemes in Europe\" with £140 million in funding? That was worth £2,000 a year of his valuable time. \n\n\nIt was a masterclass in priorities: Europe's biggest regeneration project required his oversight, but Southall's children's centres were an unaffordable luxury. \n\n\nHe could simultaneously claim there was no money for community services while helping to plan a \"[mini-Manhattan](https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/fresh-pictures-reveal-what-london-22320564)\" in his own borough. The vision was clear: 54-storey towers, yes. Children's centres, no.\n\n\nHe'd found the perfect balance: cut services locally to save money, earn money regionally to oversee developers' profits. It was like a perpetual motion machine of fiscal responsibility.\n\n\n## Chapter and Verse: The Evolution of Enlightenment\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/401141c2e5.jpg\" width=\"579\" height=\"697\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A social media post humorously discusses attending a meeting where Punjabi is spoken, with a suggestion to nod and interject occasionally.\">\n\n\nIn 2010, our future Council Leader shared his frustration about \"sitting around not understanding all this punjabi\" at community meetings in the area he would later represent. \n\n\nBy 2020, he had evolved. \"Words have consequences,\" he tweeted. \"Impact is as important as intent. Culture is defined by leadership.\"\n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7db676b2d0.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"682\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Twitter post emphasizes the importance of learning lessons about the consequences of words, the significance of impact, leadership in culture, and the possibility of redemption, encouraging reflection or change.\">\n\n\nTen years of personal growth had taught him that words matter. Which made it remarkable that he could simultaneously lecture about cultural sensitivity while closing community centres in the same diverse communities he'd once struggled to understand. It was a masterclass in progressive evolution: you could acknowledge that words have consequences while ensuring your own words from the past had none.\n\n\n## Disclaimer \n\n\nReaders who think this is all a bit unfair, unbelievable, unhelpful or downright unlawful...\n\n\nThe most revealing evidence of how the system works came from inside the machine itself. In 2022, [leaked WhatsApp messages](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hZfSB-RR7OzeCIHclKdiJd_FTnUtT7KA/view?usp=drivesdk) [pdf] from the Ealing Labour councillors' group chat revealed what they really thought about their leadership.\n\n\nMason's own Labour colleagues called the Council Leader \"callous, ruthless, sectarian.\" \n\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/c0b6a01f21.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A group chat conversation appears on a phone screen, discussing leadership support and political opinions, with messages from multiple participants.\">\n\n\nThey discussed votes of no confidence, referenced \"corruption and even theft\" regarding the previous leader, and debated \"bribes\" and \"rewards\" for loyalty. Meanwhile, publicly, they maintained perfect unity and collective responsibility. It was the perfect illustration of how the system works: private recognition of the problems, public performance of harmony. \n\n\nMrs. Patel understood perfectly. The same councillors who privately criticised authoritarian leadership accepted Mason's cabinet positions and pay rises to sit in silent support during council meetings.The leaked messages proved Mrs. Patel wasn't imagining the contradictions - even the people inside the system could see them. They just couldn't say so publicly.\n\n---\n\nURGENT support to fund a [legal challenge](https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-ealings-childrens-centres/) to Ealing Council's decision to close 10 children's centres.\n\n\n*Sources: All tweets, council documents, and quotes are publicly available and linked in the original post at [https://davidmarsden.info/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local.html](https://davidmarsden.info/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local.html)*\n\n\nTry your hand at [democracy in Ealing](https://ealing.netlify.app/interactive.html) with our fun interactive FAQs, budget calculator and decision-making process explainer!\n\n\n*Related reading: [Southall Under Siege](https://davidmarsden.info/2019/08/25/southall-under-siege.html) | [The Property Lobby](https://davidmarsden.info/2022/12/16/the-property-lobby.html) | [Air Quality Strategy Response](https://davidmarsden.info/2023/01/16/air-quality-strategy.html) | [Action you can take](https://davidmarsden.info/2025/03/09/save-ealings-childrens-centres.html) | [Think of the children](https://davidmarsden.info/2025/03/12/ealing-council-are-consulting-on.html) | [Save Ealing Children's Centres (official campaign website)](https://saveealingchildrenscentres.wordpress.com/)*\n",

It&rsquo;s taken me the best part of six weeks, all my spare time over Christmas and New Year, to get through it all, make notes and cross-reference to try to make sense of it all and offer some feedback.</p>\n<p>Really, there must be a much longer consultation period if Ealing Council is genuinely interested in residents' views.</p>\n<p>The following is a summary of what the key points of interest are for me, and in particular in relation to Southall, where I live and work. My additional suggestions are <strong>in bold</strong>, and my comments and questions in <em>italics</em>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"warning\">Warning</h4>\n<p>This is a LONG post. I&rsquo;ve tried to break it into sections to make it easier to read.</p>\n<h4 id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer</h4>\n<p><em>I don&rsquo;t claim to be an expert, other than through experience. I am just an ordinary resident living in the midst of four major industrial and construction site polluters for several years. I have campaigned alongside my family, neighbours and friends for clean air after my then nearly four year old said he wanted fresh air not stinky air. He&rsquo;d been hospitalised three times when he was two and diagnosed with asthma. We soon discovered people who had lost loved ones, had heart attacks, ectopic pregnancies, cancer, all attributed to the foul petrochemical stink.</em></p>\n<p><em>I welcome any corrections.</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"my-summary\">My Summary</h1>\n<p><strong>If Ealing is serious about &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; inequalities, action must be targeted to protect vulnerable people in Southall to reduce air pollution and its impact on the health of its large, mostly economically deprived and non-white population.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Strategy and Plan must target children and older people, people with lung conditions, and pregnant women: outside schools and school run hours. The Council must question if it is ethical to promote active travel in Southall when it knows that it is a high pollution area and that most of its population is particularly vulnerable to its adverse health impacts.</strong></p>\n<p>The draft strategy and action plan don&rsquo;t do this at all.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"clean-air-for-ealing\">Clean Air for Ealing!</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/3141352312.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy&rsquo;s vision: clean air for all Ealing residents\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents\"></p>\n<p><em>To begin, I think it’s fantastic that Ealing Council has stated its vision for clean air for all Ealing residents, in alignment with that of local residents’ campaign group <a href=\"https://southallandhayescleanair.org.uk/about/\" title=\"About page for campaign group Clean Air for Southall and Hayes\">Clean Air for Southall and Hayes</a> (CASH).</em></p>\n<p><em>CASH has been <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/cleanair-for-southall-and-hayes-stop-berkeleygroupuk-s-southallwaterside-polluting-our-kids-southalllivesmatter\" title=\"Link to Change.org petition started by CASH in 2018\">asking for clean air for residents in Southall and Hayes since 2018</a>.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/feee9005e2.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of CASH&rsquo;s About page stating: we are a community group fighting for our right to breathe clean air\" title=\"Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a community group fighting for our right to breathe clean air\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"summary-of-the-strategy-and-action-plan\">Summary of the Strategy and Action Plan</h2>\n<p>Ealing&rsquo;s draft air quality strategy&rsquo;s five stated priorities are to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce road traffic emissions</li>\n<li>Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning</li>\n<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments</li>\n<li>Invest in green infrastructure</li>\n<li>Raise awareness of air quality</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>It would be useful to see the strategy and action plan follow the same structure with clear definitions of terms, and specific and detailed aims and objectives for each priority, along with baseline air pollution levels and equalities data for each in order to monitor and measure impact.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/1629717036.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport\"></p>\n<p>Somewhat confusingly, the action plan groups its actions into six categories:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Emissions from Developments and Buildings</li>\n<li>Public health and awareness raising</li>\n<li>Delivery servicing and freight</li>\n<li>Borough fleet actions</li>\n<li>Localised solutions</li>\n<li>Cleaner transport</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>This maybe because they are copied and pasted from the previous <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/4240/air_quality_action_plan_aqap\">2017-22 action plan</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>It would be better for understanding, monitoring and evaluation to have consistency and coherence between the two documents, updating the action plan where necessary to reflect this.</strong></p>\n<p>Also somewhat confusingly, Ealing&rsquo;s draft air quality strategy has nine stated goals, starting with the obvious. I&rsquo;ll say more on these later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve air quality</li>\n<li>Tackling the climate crisis</li>\n<li>Fighting inequality</li>\n<li>Protect biodiversity</li>\n<li>Protect health and wellbeing</li>\n<li>Raise public awareness</li>\n<li>Promote sustainable infrastructure</li>\n<li>Support the transition to clean energy</li>\n<li>Creating good jobs</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"inequalities\">Inequalities</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/17f94db6cd.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\"></p>\n<p><em>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk in Ealing&rsquo;s air quality strategy about being inclusive and &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; (&ldquo;reducing&rdquo; would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; (&ldquo;exhaust trail&rdquo; might be more apt?). I&rsquo;m not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"public-health-policy\">Public Health Policy</h3>\n<p>The strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks.</p>\n<p><em>When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action</a>), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we&rsquo;ll see later, promoting active travel.</em></p>\n<p>In contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio</a>).</p>\n<p>*There&rsquo;s obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or <a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Good Growth</a>), and social policy (<a href=\"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet\" title=\"Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios\">Tackling Inequalities</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.</strong></p>\n<p>The strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant.</p>\n<p><em>Ealing&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profiles/2019/E09000009.html?area-name=Ealing\">Health Profile from 2019</a> puts that figure in some context:</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/35109e01b4.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of Ealing&rsquo;s 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\" title=\"Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"air-pollution-in-ealing\">Air Pollution in Ealing</h2>\n<h3 id=\"pollution-sources\">Pollution Sources</h3>\n<p>The strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy.</p>\n<p>Those most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women.</p>\n<p><strong>It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo;, especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).</strong></p>\n<p><em>I don&rsquo;t believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.</em></p>\n<p>The strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.</p>\n<p><em>Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/adc0267e1f.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\"></p>\n<p><em>On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/12c505256e.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\"></p>\n<p><em>In the graphics from the 2017-22 action plan, wood burning doesn&rsquo;t get a look-in at all, data from 2013.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f0df8bd46e.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\"></p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.</strong></p>\n<p><em>The good news is that road traffic emissions, the council&rsquo;s key action area for 2022-30, reduced significantly in Ealing between 2013 and 2019.</em></p>\n<p><strong>It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"air-quality-monitoring\">Air Quality Monitoring</h3>\n<p>The strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/0996242a03.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\"></p>\n<p><em>It&rsquo;s worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/pm2.5_in_london_october19.pdf\" title=\"PDF\">background levels of PM2.5</a> in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO&rsquo;s target.</em></p>\n<p>The draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.</p>\n<p>Ealing has 67 air quality monitors across the borough, all recording levels of nitrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulate matter (PM10 only).</p>\n<p><em>It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although there are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as <a href=\"https://www.airqualityengland.co.uk/local-authority/?la_id=191\" title=\"Air Quality England: Southall monitors\">The Green Quarter</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Ealing publishes annual air quality <a href=\"https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/Reports.aspx\">status reports</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Ealing also has <a href=\"https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/DiffusionTubes.aspx\">an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites</a> where you can see graphical annual data summary charts.

Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council&rsquo;s response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn&rsquo;t give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Wouldn&rsquo;t this be fantastic?! Again, the Council&rsquo;s response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents' needs for clean air first, and above developers' desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Invest in green infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Southall has the least <a href=\"https://www.ealingitree.online/stories/canopy-cover/0\" title=\"Tree canopy cover in Ealing\">tree canopy cover in Ealing</a>, yet is subjected to <a href=\"https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns\" title=\"Over-development of Southall\">massive overdevelopment</a>. This almost entirely terraced town is being transformed into a new Manhattan.</em></p>\n<p><em>The one concession negotiated hard by our elected representatives, and granted by the London Mayor for overruling local democracy to allow the Gasworks development, was to widen the South Road bridge by the train station to ease the often gridlocked road. Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the &lsquo;reset&rsquo; button. Having sat on the Mayor&rsquo;s money and done nothing for so long it&rsquo;s no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new &lsquo;pocket park&rsquo; outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-&lsquo;orchards&rsquo; planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the &lsquo;Poison Park&rsquo; to look forward to, the &lsquo;green space&rsquo; crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.</em></p>\n<p><strong>If the council&rsquo;s air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a &lsquo;compromise&rsquo; to <a href=\"https://ealing.news/environment/environmentalists-tell-ealing-council-and-its-leader-peter-mason-their-actions-will-result-in-ecocide-and-are-environmentally-reckless-and-ecologically-illiterate-over-warren-farm-sports-p\" title=\"Ealing News coverage of Warren Farm story\">destroy most of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall</a> in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don&rsquo;t want.

They must engage with Southall residents suffering the worst of the air pollution from multiple sources, and stop denying or minimising the existence and extent of the problems, and proactively and collaboratively work to reduce or stop such pollution episodes continuing.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Otherwise, the council&rsquo;s strategy isn&rsquo;t worth the virtual paper it&rsquo;s printed on, and is just more hot air.</em></p>\n<p><em>What we have in the draft plan, however, is largely a copy-and-paste of the previous 2017-2022 plan, which was, at worst, a demonstrable failure of ambition, leadership and political will, and, at best, a simple failure of the council to do what it said it would do.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"strategy-goals\">Strategy Goals</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve air quality. Protect the health and wellbeing of Ealing residents from the harmful effects\nof nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) air pollution.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The strategy MUST have the inclusive goal of protecting residents from the harmful effects of ALL air pollutants (not just nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter).</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Tackling the climate crisis&hellip;. by aiming for the highest environmental standards.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The &ldquo;highest environmental standards&rdquo; must be clearly stated and defined.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Fighting inequality&hellip;. to ensure that no-one is left behind&hellip; [and] residents feel safe.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The strategy must ensure that inequalities are reduced, that ALL residents are included in this process, and that their concerns for the safety of their air are taken seriously and acted upon.</strong> <em>Promoting the uptake of expensive electric vehicles and discounting parking spaces for them is discriminating against economically deprived mostly non-white people who suffer most from air pollution.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Protect biodiversity.

It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”. Residents were never informed if, when or how levels of naphthalene were urgently reduced.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7ee1493a47.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council&rsquo;s statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment\" title=\"Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment\"></p>\n<p>It’s noteworthy that the Council claims it asked PHE to get involved only <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201031045353/https://www.ealing.gov.uk/news/article/2035/statement_on_phe_southall_waterside_risk_assessment\" title=\"Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment\">“following concerns raised by local residents”</a> and not because the Council itself carried out an Equalities Impact Assessment prior to works starting in 2016, knowing that the Southall population was significantly more vulnerable to air pollution due to high pre-existing levels and multiple inequalities.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the council says it responded to residents' concerns by installing &ldquo;independent&rdquo; air quality monitors on site in 2021, but this is five years after the work started, and two years after the main source of air pollution and odour complaints (the so-called soil &ldquo;hospital&rdquo;) was decommissioned. The monitors now installed record near-real time data for “urban background” emissions of odourless particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/76615b310f.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns\"></p>\n<p>The odours and air pollution that residents are concerned about originate from polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (i.e., the hundred years’ of toxic waste from town gas, coal tar and petrochemical work sites).

The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!</p>\n<h3 id=\"public-health\">Public Health</h3>\n<p>We are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. <strong>Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?</strong> The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?</p>\n<p>Moreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years' of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. <strong>Why wasn&rsquo;t truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"enforcement\">Enforcement</h3>\n<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?</p>\n<p>The council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks.

Included a number of no-or-low-impact schemes such as Low Emission Neighbourhoods (LENs), implemented in 2021 as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. <strong>Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/8be373b743.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don&rsquo;t reduce air pollution\" title=\"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution\"></p>\n<p>b. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. <strong>Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.</strong></p>\n<p>c. Another low impact scheme was Play Streets. <strong>How many Play Streets are there now? How often do they run? Where are they?</strong></p>\n<p>d. <strong>How many Pocket Parks are there?

				"content_text": "Ealing Council's [draft Air Quality Strategy][1] is a 64 page document together with a 40 page [Action Plan][2], and the consultation period runs until 30 January 2023. It's taken me the best part of six weeks, all my spare time over Christmas and New Year, to get through it all, make notes and cross-reference to try to make sense of it all and offer some feedback. \n\nReally, there must be a much longer consultation period if Ealing Council is genuinely interested in residents' views.\n\nThe following is a summary of what the key points of interest are for me, and in particular in relation to Southall, where I live and work. My additional suggestions are **in bold**, and my comments and questions in *italics*.\n\n#### Warning\n\nThis is a LONG post. I've tried to break it into sections to make it easier to read.\n\n#### Disclaimer \n\n*I don't claim to be an expert, other than through experience. I am just an ordinary resident living in the midst of four major industrial and construction site polluters for several years. I have campaigned alongside my family, neighbours and friends for clean air after my then nearly four year old said he wanted fresh air not stinky air. He'd been hospitalised three times when he was two and diagnosed with asthma. We soon discovered people who had lost loved ones, had heart attacks, ectopic pregnancies, cancer, all attributed to the foul petrochemical stink.*\n\n*I welcome any corrections.*\n\n# My Summary\n\n**If Ealing is serious about \"fighting\" inequalities, action must be targeted to protect vulnerable people in Southall to reduce air pollution and its impact on the health of its large, mostly economically deprived and non-white population.**\n\n**The Strategy and Plan must target children and older people, people with lung conditions, and pregnant women: outside schools and school run hours. The Council must question if it is ethical to promote active travel in Southall when it knows that it is a high pollution area and that most of its population is particularly vulnerable to its adverse health impacts.**\n\nThe draft strategy and action plan don't do this at all.\n\n---\n\n# Clean Air for Ealing!\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/3141352312.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the strategy's vision: clean air for all Ealing residents\")\n\n*To begin, I think it’s fantastic that Ealing Council has stated its vision for clean air for all Ealing residents, in alignment with that of local residents’ campaign group [Clean Air for Southall and Hayes][3] (CASH).*\n\n*CASH has been [asking for clean air for residents in Southall and Hayes since 2018][4].*\n\n![Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a community group fighting for our right to breathe clean air](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/feee9005e2.jpg \"Screenshot of CASH's About page stating: we are a community group fighting for our right to breathe clean air\")\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the Strategy and Action Plan\n\nEaling's draft air quality strategy's five stated priorities are to:\n\n> - Reduce road traffic emissions\n> - Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning\n> - Reduce emissions from construction of new developments\n> - Invest in green infrastructure\n> - Raise awareness of air quality\n\n**It would be useful to see the strategy and action plan follow the same structure with clear definitions of terms, and specific and detailed aims and objectives for each priority, along with baseline air pollution levels and equalities data for each in order to monitor and measure impact.**\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/1629717036.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport\")\n\nSomewhat confusingly, the action plan groups its actions into six categories: \n\n> - Emissions from Developments and Buildings\n> - Public health and awareness raising\n> - Delivery servicing and freight\n> - Borough fleet actions\n> - Localised solutions\n> - Cleaner transport\n\n*This maybe because they are copied and pasted from the previous [2017-22 action plan][5].*\n\n**It would be better for understanding, monitoring and evaluation to have consistency and coherence between the two documents, updating the action plan where necessary to reflect this.**\n\nAlso somewhat confusingly, Ealing's draft air quality strategy has nine stated goals, starting with the obvious. I'll say more on these later:\n\n> 1. Improve air quality\n> 2. Tackling the climate crisis\n> 3. Fighting inequality\n> 4. Protect biodiversity\n> 5. Protect health and wellbeing\n> 6. Raise public awareness\n> 7. Promote sustainable infrastructure\n> 8. Support the transition to clean energy\n> 9. Creating good jobs\n\n---\n\n### Inequalities \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/17f94db6cd.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint\")\n\n*There's a lot of talk in Ealing's air quality strategy about being inclusive and \"fighting\" (\"reducing\" would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution \"footprint\" (\"exhaust trail\" might be more apt?). I'm not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.*\n\n---\n\n### Public Health Policy\n\nThe strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks. \n\n*When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the [Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action][6]), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we'll see later, promoting active travel.*\n\nIn contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing's [Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio][6]).\n\n*There's obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or [Good Growth][6]), and social policy ([Tackling Inequalities][6]). \n\n**It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.**\n\nThe strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant. \n\n*Ealing's [Health Profile from 2019][7] puts that figure in some context:*\n\n![Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/35109e01b4.jpg \"Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer\")\n\n---\n\n## Air Pollution in Ealing\n\n### Pollution Sources \n\nThe strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy. \n\nThose most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women. \n\n**It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution \"hotspots\", especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).** \n\n*I don't believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.*\n\nThe strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.\n\n*Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).*\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/adc0267e1f.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning\")\n\n*On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):*\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/12c505256e.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter\")\n\n*In the graphics from the 2017-22 action plan, wood burning doesn't get a look-in at all, data from 2013.* \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f0df8bd46e.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together\")\n\n**It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.**\n\n*The good news is that road traffic emissions, the council's key action area for 2022-30, reduced significantly in Ealing between 2013 and 2019.* \n\n**It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.**\n\n---\n\n### Air Quality Monitoring \n\nThe strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/0996242a03.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO\")\n\n*It's worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the [background levels of PM2.5][8] in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO's target.*\n\nThe draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.\n\nEaling has 67 air quality monitors across the borough, all recording levels of nitrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulate matter (PM10 only). \n\n*It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although there are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as [The Green Quarter][9].*\n\nEaling publishes annual air quality [status reports][10].\n\n*Ealing also has [an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites][11] where you can see graphical annual data summary charts. Unfortunately, none seem to have been updated since 2021.*\n\n![Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/58dfd151de.jpg \"Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021\") \n\n**It would be useful to have more monitors for particulate matter, especially PM2.5, across the borough, and in Southall, and for published data from all air pollution monitors to be kept accessible and up-to-date.**\n\n---\n\n## Priorities for Action\n\nBack to the strategy's priorities for action, and my *comments and questions*, and **suggestions**.\n\n> - Reduce road traffic emissions. \n\n*The biggest reduction in road traffic emissions came during 2020 covid lockdowns, and while it's not practical, feasible or desirable to replicate that going forward, it might be worth promoting the idea that employers should encourage and support an increase to the 36% of Ealing's working age population already mainly [working from home][12] whenever possible, as opposed to the current political groupthink that everyone must return to the office in order to be productive.*\n\n> - Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning. \n\n*There are two wood-burning incinerators close to my home, which frequently create disgusting burning plastic odours forcing us to stay indoors and close all our windows. Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council's response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn't give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.*\n\n> - Reduce emissions from construction of new developments. \n\n*Wouldn't this be fantastic?! Again, the Council's response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents' needs for clean air first, and above developers' desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?*\n\n> - Invest in green infrastructure. \n\n*Southall has the least [tree canopy cover in Ealing][13], yet is subjected to [massive overdevelopment][14]. This almost entirely terraced town is being transformed into a new Manhattan.* \n\n*The one concession negotiated hard by our elected representatives, and granted by the London Mayor for overruling local democracy to allow the Gasworks development, was to widen the South Road bridge by the train station to ease the often gridlocked road. Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the 'reset' button. Having sat on the Mayor's money and done nothing for so long it's no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new 'pocket park' outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-'orchards' planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the 'Poison Park' to look forward to, the 'green space' crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.*\n\n**If the council's air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.** \n\n*Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a 'compromise' to [destroy most of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall][15] in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don't want. I don't understand how the Leader's desires complement the Council's stated strategies to reduce air pollution, tackle the climate emergency they declared, and to protect and promote biodiversity and our ecosystem.*\n\n- Raise awareness of air quality. \n\n*The council also wants to (and must) lead by example.* \n\n**If the council really wants to lead by example on reducing air pollution, then the council Leader cannot accept or request car rides to or from meetings in Southall, councillors cannot park in cycle lanes in Southall, nor fly to the property developer festival in the south of France. They must engage with Southall residents suffering the worst of the air pollution from multiple sources, and stop denying or minimising the existence and extent of the problems, and proactively and collaboratively work to reduce or stop such pollution episodes continuing.** \n\n*Otherwise, the council's strategy isn't worth the virtual paper it's printed on, and is just more hot air.*\n\n*What we have in the draft plan, however, is largely a copy-and-paste of the previous 2017-2022 plan, which was, at worst, a demonstrable failure of ambition, leadership and political will, and, at best, a simple failure of the council to do what it said it would do.*\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Goals\n\n> 1. Improve air quality. Protect the health and wellbeing of Ealing residents from the harmful effects\n> of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) air pollution. \n\n**The strategy MUST have the inclusive goal of protecting residents from the harmful effects of ALL air pollutants (not just nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter).**.\n\n> 2. Tackling the climate crisis.... by aiming for the highest environmental standards. \n\n**The \"highest environmental standards\" must be clearly stated and defined.**\n\n> 3. Fighting inequality.... to ensure that no-one is left behind... [and] residents feel safe. \n\n**The strategy must ensure that inequalities are reduced, that ALL residents are included in this process, and that their concerns for the safety of their air are taken seriously and acted upon.** *Promoting the uptake of expensive electric vehicles and discounting parking spaces for them is discriminating against economically deprived mostly non-white people who suffer most from air pollution.*\n\n> 4. Protect biodiversity. Ensuring our parks, open spaces and nature are protected and enhanced. \n\n*This is particularly relevant right now, as the Council Leader pushes on with his undemocratic desire to destroy much of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall, and killing off a quarter of London's endangered skylarks, in order to build new sports pitches and/or a football stadium.*\n\n> 5. Protect health and wellbeing. Protecting and enhancing the physical and mental health of all. \n\n*Except in Southall? [Public Health England's four risk assessment reports][16] into the Southall Gasworks poisoning clearly stated that \"Odours can cause nuisance amongst the population possibly leading to stress and anxiety. Some people may experience symptoms such as nausea, headaches or dizziness.\"*\n\n> 6. Raise public awareness. Promoting awareness of the causes and impacts of air quality issues, as well as the available local solutions.... encouraging community activism.... \n\n*Except in Southall? At every opportunity, Ealing Council has sought to erase, deny or minimise the causes and impacts of air quality issues related to Southall Gasworks, refused to enforce any local solutions, and actively discouraged and attempted to prevent community activists' voices from being heard.*\n\n> 7. Promote sustainable infrastructure. Ensure local transport and development planning supports investment in sustainable infrastructure, that limits impact on air quality, enabling a shift to low-emission transport and energy options. \n\n*Except in Southall? The Council recently [decided NOT to widen the South Road bridge in Southall][17]. Widening the bridge, as promised, would ease congestion, and improve air quality, public transport and active travel options. The bridge widening was the one concession granted to the Southall community when the London Mayor overruled local democracy to give the go ahead to development of the highly contaminated Southall Gasworks site.*\n\n> 8. Support the transition to clean energy. Supporting the uptake of low-emission energy technologies and improvements in efficiencies, and reducing reliance on the consumption of fossil and solid fuels. \n\n*Like [in Chile][18]? Simply promoting and encouraging more (low emission) cars isn’t going to reduce congestion, emissions from brake and tyre wear, or help to reduce our “reliance on the consumption of fossil fuels”. Ealing [reportedly doesn’t have enough power on the electricity grid for new homes until 2030][19].* \n\n> 9. Creating good jobs. We want to... deliver an ambitious programme of building more genuinely affordable homes. \n\n*Ealing is [building fewer genuinely affordable homes than ever][20], and [making the housing crisis in Ealing worse][21] by [demolishing more social rent homes][22] than it is building.*\n\n---\n\n## Spotlight on Southall \n\nThese are all my comments, so I'm not putting it all in *italics.*\n\nMy suggestions and questions for the strategy are still in **bold.**\n\n**Southall cannot be used as a good example of how Ealing Council takes air pollution seriously.** \n\n### Inequalities\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b507cd1558.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people\") \n\nSouthall has a [BAME population of more than 90%][23].\n\nSouthall Broadway/West and Southall Green are the two council wards that border the old Gasworks site, and which are downwind from the FM Conway asphalt and Tarmac plants, and the two wood-burning incinerators, depending on wind direction. They are connected by the Gasworks site and by the Air Quality Focus Area from South Road to The Green, King Street and Western Road.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/620d0a35d2.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites\")\n\nSouthall is already a high pollution area (and an Air Quality Focus Area as a result), but has several additive sources of unmitigated, uncontrolled air pollution.\n\nEconomically poorer, BAME people, children, older people and pregnant women are the most vulnerable to the health impacts of toxic air pollution. Certainly not a fairer start for Southall’s children.\n\nWe know from bitter experience over the last six years in Southall that the council has failed in its duty to protect some of its most vulnerable residents from harm.\n\n### Raising Awareness\n\nTo add insult to injury, the council failed to raise public awareness of the risks and the air quality monitoring data in an open and transparent manner before work on the site began, and while the work was in progress. It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”. Residents were never informed if, when or how levels of naphthalene were urgently reduced.\n\n![Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7ee1493a47.jpg \"Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment\")\n\nIt’s noteworthy that the Council claims it asked PHE to get involved only [“following concerns raised by local residents”][24] and not because the Council itself carried out an Equalities Impact Assessment prior to works starting in 2016, knowing that the Southall population was significantly more vulnerable to air pollution due to high pre-existing levels and multiple inequalities.\n\nSimilarly, the council says it responded to residents' concerns by installing \"independent\" air quality monitors on site in 2021, but this is five years after the work started, and two years after the main source of air pollution and odour complaints (the so-called soil \"hospital\") was decommissioned. The monitors now installed record near-real time data for “urban background” emissions of odourless particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/76615b310f.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns\")\n\nThe odours and air pollution that residents are concerned about originate from polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (i.e., the hundred years’ of toxic waste from town gas, coal tar and petrochemical work sites). We are told that there are diffusion tubes monitoring these emissions, but there is a total lack of openness and transparency as to their locations and the data they have recorded. The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!\n\n### Public Health\n\nWe are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. **Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?** The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?\n\nMoreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years' of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and \"cleaned\" in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. **Why wasn't truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?**\n\n### Enforcement\n\nWhy didn't the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?\n\nThe council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks. Indeed half of the plan was missing from the planning portal and [the council admitted that it didn't have a full copy of the original CMP][25]. \n\n**How on earth was the council planning to enforce a CMP it wasn’t in possession of?** This was a gross dereliction of duty to care for the health and wellbeing of (by its own definition) the most vulnerable residents in the borough.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/43138639f4.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites\")\n\n**The Council was committed to full enclosure of waste sites in its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan. Why wasn’t the one hundred years of petrochemical waste \"soil cleaning hospital” enclosed?**\n\n[National Grid have enclosed their enclosed their soil remediation work][26] specifically to avoid causing odour nuisance to the local community (and thanks no doubt to campaigning by local residents and activists at Clean Air for Southall and Hayes).\n\n### On Whose Side?\n\nWhy did the former and current council leader [accept over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group][27] to fly (!) to the south of France for what Private Eye Magazine describes as [a booze and hookerfest][28]?\n\nThe new council leader claims he went there to negotiate hard. If that's the case, what did he negotiate? He also claimed that it wasn't what he expected and that it was a mistake to go. If that's also the case, [why was it a mistake][29]?\n\n**How can we be sure that the new council leader and his administration won't continue making these mistakes and taking the side of developers rather than standing up for the residents they are elected to represent?**\n\n### Local  Action\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/726113aef4.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response\")\n\n**If the soil is now clean and the air is safe to breathe, why would stopping works during hot weather (which didn’t happen in 2018), and covering stockpiles (why weren’t they covered already?) be given as examples of possible mitigating actions?**\n\n**There must be a new commitment to work with and for residents where these are issues. Air pollution and odour nuisance reporting and investigation procedures need to be overhauled as they are currently not fit for purpose (reporting process too convoluted, each one investigated as a single, isolated incident rather than as part of an ongoing problem, residents are simply not believed and our reports are minimised and invalidated).** \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/2cf1bdd0de.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality\")\n\n**Work on the Gasworks site is due to complete in 2038. Why is the date for net-zero emissions set for twelve years after this date in 2050?**\n\nThere's a similar commitment to target zero-emissions for construction vehicles by 2040, which is two years after the new draft local Plan period for new developments ends. \n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/4843e8295e.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers\")\n\n**What has Ealing Council done to date to campaign for greater regulatory powers and for a Clean Air Act? Please give examples.**\n\nThis draft Air Quality Strategy is fine in many respects in terms of the words it contains, but what concerns me is that these are empty words if they are not acted on and enforced.\n\nRecent history strongly suggests the council doesn't have the leadership, organisational culture or political will to act in the interests of its most vulnerable residents in Southall.\n\n### Active Travel\n\nThere's a lot of talk about active travel and Ealing Council's multi-million pound Let's Go Southall campaign in the draft Strategy, but [very little on its real cost and impact][31]. They seem to have about 50 regular weekly activity groups. Over two years that's 5,000 sessions. 30,000 attendances (not individuals). So average of six people per session? 1,000 people attended at least two sessions (repeat attendances). My guess would be not many more than 1,000 in total, most will be repeaters (thinking GP referrals, lots of organisers?). If it's helped 1,000 individuals, that's £5,400 per person. If 10,000 it's £540 per person (still seems like a lot of money). And there's no evidence that it's helped anyone! \n\n**The council must be open and transparent with residents that Let's Go Southall is a top-down neoliberal behavioural change (\"nudge theory\") programme led by a retired stockbroker, and not the \"grassroots social movement\" of the council's Orwellian publicity.**\n\n**If the Council is serious about improving safe active travel options in Southall, then it must improve road and pavement conditions and safety first. Many of the roads and pavements are not fit to cycle or walk on, especially for children and families, older people, and people with disabilities.**\n\n---\n\n# Air Quality Action Plan\n\n## The 2017-2022 Action Plan\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f573809dce.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution\")\n\na. Included a number of no-or-low-impact schemes such as Low Emission Neighbourhoods (LENs), implemented in 2021 as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. **Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?**\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/8be373b743.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution\")\n\nb. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. **Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.**\n\nc. Another low impact scheme was Play Streets. **How many Play Streets are there now? How often do they run? Where are they?**\n\nd. **How many Pocket Parks are there? Where are they?**\n\ne. **How many Green Screens  are there? Where are they? Why were green screens not erected at Southall Gasworks even after residents complained of dust from the site in their homes?**\n\nf. **How are these schemes evaluated in terms of reducing air pollution? Where are the air quality monitors located to record baseline measurements to compare against air pollution levels during or after the scheme is in place?**\n\ng. **Enforcement of anti-idling laws was deemed \"not cost-effective\". Smoke control was not deemed a problem and therefore not promoted or enforced. Who made these decisions?**\n\nh. **What is the wider 'cost' to residents in not taking enforcement action against these criminal behaviours?**\n\n## The 2022-2027 Action Plan (AQAP)\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/73f624c5da.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone\")\n\n**If air pollution monitoring data cannot inform the efficacy of individual actions, how can it be used in combination with secondary data to do so?** I'm sure there must be a sensible explanation, but to most people I suspect this statement makes little sense. In Southall, we have continuously been asked to ignore our own lived experience of health and quality of life problems attributed to the open-air 'cleaning' of a hundred years of petrochemical waste at the Gasworks site, in favour of the developer Berkeley's assurances that it's own monitoring of air quality is 'within acceptable limits' and harmless to health. Public Health England published four risk assessments based on Berkeley's data, and came to similar conclusions, although neither looked at any secondary data. The air pollution data has still to be published so that the public can make up their own minds.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b26fce3d39.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution\")\n\n![](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/a5185741a3.jpg)\n\nI'm not sure how imperceptible changes that cannot be detected by monitoring or modelling can be interpreted as Low Impact or a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Action Plan here seems to contradict the Strategy by stating that changes in the levels of air pollution above a certain level can be attributed even to individual actions (although more likely to be due to multiple actions).\n\n**If the council is serious about using air pollution data and secondary data to establish efficacy of its air quality strategy and action plan, (which sounds sensible enough), then it must explain what measures it will use, and publish baseline data and regular updates.** \n\nLike it does with its [performance dashboard][30].  \n  \nLooking at the Council's own evaluation of its 2017-22 Action Plan, I would suggest that its achievements are minimal, and misleading.\n\n![Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/6aa8ea88ed.jpg \"Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan\")\n\nElectric Vehicle charging points (p. 30 of 2022 AQAP) were not actually a specified target in the 2017 AQAP, so I'm unsure how this can be claimed as an achievement? Similarly with School Streets and specific cycle lanes. LENS/LTNs were specified as a target, but there is no mention of that fiasco here. **Air quality monitoring data must be used to locate pollution hotspots for any future implementation of LENs/LTNs**\n\nThe 20 mph speed limit was implemented borough-wide, but only since December 2021. Why did it take so long? What is the use of it if it isn’t enforced, especially in Southall?  \n  \n[1]: https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7039/ealing_council_air_quality_strategy_2020-30\n\n[2]:

Ever!</p>\n\n<p>Ealing Council Leader Julian Bell publicly blamed 'the wrong kind of wind', and – quite possibly – privately blamed 'fucking moaners'. All the while racking up over £30,000 in declared gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group, who were digging up the gasworks land.</p>\n\n<p>Our soon-to-be local ward councillor and (ex-)Head of Planning Peter Mason knew all about the dangers (he tells us on Twitter) from the contaminated land back in 2009 when he campaigned against its development along with our MP Virendra Sharma (who said the development would be 'a disaster environmentally').</p>\n\n<p>Yet no one told people living nearby to expect to be gassed in our own homes and gardens during the three month heatwave that was shortly to arrive.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Ealing Council announced on Twitter that the odours, while 'unpleasant', were 'not harmful to health' would be 'gone in a few days'.</p>\n\n<p>I later discovered that there is scientific evidence that some people with Asian and African heritages are genetically more vulnerable to very serious and sometimes fatal health conditions from inhaling naphthalene, a fact acknowledged (although later denied, despite the published evidence) by Public Health England at a packed public meeting in July 2019.</p>\n\n<p>No one told us.</p>\n\n<p>Ealing Council, despite being fully aware of the potential dangers to health (and to the environment) failed to carry out any kind of Equalities Impact Assessment, and only helped Berkeley Group to rush through the decontamination process to maximise their profit from Crossrail in Southall.</p>\n\n<p>Profit over people. Labour Council. Our lives didn't matter to them.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we are being asked to believe that our MP (who has begun making the right noises two years too late – what happened to the nearly 1,000 signature petition I gave you in 2018 Mr Sharma?) cares and is on our side, and that our local ward councillor cares and always has done. Only Bell is – unusually for him – honest enough not to suddenly pretend he gives a shit about anyone but himself and looking after his own family.</p>\n\n<p>At the packed public meeting in 2019, which our local ward councillor chaired, he and Bell refused to declare their financial interests with Berkeley Group, refused to let me speak with the microphone so that people couldn't hear that the Council, Berkeley Group, the Environment Agency and Public Health England had all colluded to cover up the real level of toxic and carcinogenic air pollution – that it was consistently above legal limits and rising – by manipulating, removing, and presenting the air quality data in such a way as to make it look like it was mostly within legal limits.</p>\n\n<p>At the same meeting, our MP arrived late, mostly unseen, sat silently at the back of the room, and left early, mostly unseen.\nAt the same meeting, a strangely truthful Bell admitted that he had 'known about the nuisance, the BAD nuisance, for two and a half years'! Yet nothing could be done.</p>\n\n<p>Now Peter Mason, free from his constraints as Head of Planning after resigning following his failed coup attempt to take the leadership from Bell last year, is telling us that something could and should have been done, yet all of them remained silent and did nothing for years.</p>\n\n<p>Unbelievable!</p>\n",

He sneaked in, sat at the back mostly unseen by anyone there, and then left early.</p>\n\n<p>A bit like his time as an MP!</p>\n\n<p>So, at this meeting.</p>\n\n<p>We discovered that Asian and African people, the majority of people in Southall, are genetically more at risk from poisoning from naphthalene.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma have to say about that?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>For two years or more, Southallians have complained to Mr Sharma about the oppressive stink, and poison air, coming from the old gasworks site. I have suffered numerous chest infections, my wife had serious and severe health problems, and my young son has been hospitalised with asthma and now has to take steroids every day of his life so that he can breathe. I know neighbours whose loved ones have now got cancer, and some who have died from cancer. All, we believe, caused by the poison air.</p>\n\n<p>What has Mr Sharma done to help us?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, a group of us presented Mr Sharma with a petition signed by 900 Southallians and their families and friends begging Mr Sharma to do something to get Berkeley Group, the developer of the old gasworks site, to stop poisoning Southall.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma do?</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, throughout the last couple of years, while his constituents in Southall Green have been poisoned by the toxic air from the old gasworks site, and getting ill with breathing problems, and cancer, the developer Berkeley Group has sponsored numerous local events, mainly to 'clean up' Southall.</p>\n\n<p>What did Mr Sharma do?</p>\n\n<p>He attended every one and was photographed smiling broadly wearing his hi-viz jacket with the Berkeley Group logo emblazoned across it.</p>\n\n<p>So tonight, I'm voting in favour of the trigger ballot for Mr Sharma, so that we have the opportunity to have a new Labour MP for Ealing Southall, one who will stand up for local people rather than help those who oppress them.</p>\n\n<p>And I ask all of you to do the same.</p>\n\n<p>Solidarity!</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Sharma was triggered for reselection, but survived without having to stand again thanks to his old pal Boris Johnson, who called a general election shortly after.</p>\n",
