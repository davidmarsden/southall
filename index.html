			 <p>A couple of weeks ago, big kid sang at the Royal Albert Hall in &ldquo;<a href="https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/events/2025/ealing-together-harmony-in-diversity">Ealing Together: Harmony in Diversity</a>,&rdquo; performing lyrics by Jewish socialist and renowned children&rsquo;s author Michael Rosen in a new song &ldquo;Ada in Ealing&rdquo;, a celebration of a former Ealing resident, and the world&rsquo;s first computer programmer and a pioneer of mathematical logic, Ada Lovelace.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Tonight he performed in his school&rsquo;s musical version of The Pied Piper of Hamelin, a story about broken promises and failed leadership. The stage lights went out halfway through, but the show went on - the children kept singing, the story kept unfolding, and somehow the adults pulling the strings behind the scenes got the lights back on.</p>
<p>The biggest laugh from the grown ups watching came when the council leader overcame his cognitive dissonance about political dishonesty by not paying the piper due to budget constraints: &ldquo;For a politician to lie?! It&rsquo;s disgusting, disgraceful, dishonourable&hellip;. Dis could be the perfect solution!&rdquo; They all understood perfectly.</p>
<p>Sitting in that school hall, watching children perform a story about adults who make promises they don&rsquo;t keep, I realised I&rsquo;d been writing about the same tale in &ldquo;<a href="https://southall.davidmarsden.info/2025/07/11/perceval-house-w-where-local/">Perceval House W5</a>.&rdquo; The Pied Piper isn&rsquo;t just a fairy story - it&rsquo;s a documentary about local politics.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The council leader in Hamelin promises to solve the rat problem but refuses to pay when the Piper delivers. Sound familiar? Promise to &ldquo;put people before buildings,&rdquo; then close the buildings. Promise &ldquo;transparent engagement,&rdquo; then rewrite petition rules to stop residents asking questions. Promise to protect services by cutting them.</p>
<p>From celebrating Ada Lovelace - a woman who saw logical patterns others couldn&rsquo;t - to performing a story about leaders who&rsquo;ve abandoned logic entirely. The journey from The Royal Albert Hall to the primary school hall, from Ealing to Hamelin and back again, from songs about a mathematics logician to tales about a corrupt politician.</p>
<p>Ada Lovelace would have spotted the <a href="https://ealing.netlify.app/interactive.html">flawed algorithm</a> immediately: spend £1 million on councillor allowances to save £750,000 on children&rsquo;s centres. The logic doesn&rsquo;t compute.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;d also have recognised the pattern in the Pied Piper story. He who pays the piper calls the tune. In Ealing, we&rsquo;re discovering who&rsquo;s really been programming our decision-makers.</p>
<p>Unelected developers and council officers concocted a plan to sell off community assets. Berkeley Group paid for MIPIM trips. The council issued compulsory purchase orders to demolish people&rsquo;s homes to make way for a new road and Berkeley&rsquo;s marketing suite opposite the new Elizabeth Line station. The council is &ldquo;powerless&rdquo; to prevent Berkeley Group poisoning the Southall community, like the rats in the nursery playground. The algorithm executes perfectly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the original tale, the children disappear forever when the adults break their promises. But big kid&rsquo;s generation might rewrite that ending. They&rsquo;ve already shown they understand the contradictions better than the politicians creating them.</p>
<p>When then five year old Zion asked the Council Leader directly about the gasworks poisoning and got a &ldquo;too sciencey&rdquo; response, he understood perfectly what was happening. Tonight, performing as part of a story about broken promises and failed leadership, he understood it perfectly, too.</p>
<p>The lights failed, but the children kept going. The system breaks down, but the community adapts. Sometimes the show must go on until the grown-ups remember how to keep their promises.</p>
<p>And sometimes, just sometimes, the lights come back on.</p>

			 <p>🎧 I fed my satirical piece about Ealing&rsquo;s democratic innovations into Google&rsquo;s NotebookLM.</p>
<p>Two AI hosts discovered how perfectly logical it is to close children&rsquo;s centres while voting yourself a 70% pay rise. They marveled at the mathematical elegance of spending £1 million on councillor allowances to save £750,000 on community services. They found it remarkable that one person could tweet about &ldquo;putting people before buildings&rdquo; and then close the very buildings where people access services without experiencing any cognitive dissonance whatsoever.</p>
<p>The AIs were particularly impressed by Ealing&rsquo;s latest innovation: rewriting petition rules to prevent residents from asking follow-up questions. Democracy 2.0 - now with less democracy! Much more efficient than the old system where people could actually influence things.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing the machines found most puzzling: impossible things keep happening in Ealing. Communities save their Young Adult Centre. They protect their Town Hall. They refuse to accept that decisions have been made.</p>
<p>Mrs. Patel might just save her children&rsquo;s centre too.</p>
<p>The Save Ealing Children&rsquo;s Centres campaign is live. The AIs think this is statistically improbable. Mrs. Patel understands perfectly.</p>

			 <p><em>The Children&rsquo;s Centres Crusade</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="chapter-1-the-art-of-political-contradiction">Chapter 1: The Art of Political Contradiction</h2>
<p>In the London Borough of Ealing, our elected representatives have perfected something remarkable: the ability to hold completely contradictory public positions without experiencing any apparent cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>Take our Council Leader. On January 15, 2015, he tweeted: <em>&ldquo;Think its really important that we put people before buildings. Important we keep activities going &amp; that can be done in a different way.&quot;</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ten years later, he&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xv1ylplzzo">closing children&rsquo;s centres</a>, buildings where people access those activities.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t hypocrisy - it&rsquo;s innovation. Why limit yourself to consistent principles when you can have all the principles, simultaneously?</p>
<p>Mrs. Patel, a parent trying to save her local children&rsquo;s centre, discovered this when she attempted to navigate Ealing&rsquo;s democratic processes. What she found was a system so logically perfect that resistance had become mathematically impossible.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-the-democratic-möbius-strip">Chapter 2: The Democratic Möbius Strip</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Who decides about children&rsquo;s centre closures?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked at a council meeting.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;The Cabinet,&rdquo; she was told.</p>
<p>The Cabinet explained they were implementing officer recommendations based on budget pressures created by government policy following community consultation showing residents wanted services maintained differently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So who can change the decision?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The decision-makers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are the decision-makers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people with authority to make decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has that authority?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The decision-makers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Patel found herself trapped in a perfectly circular system. To influence the decision, she needed to identify who made it. But everyone who appeared to make decisions claimed to be implementing someone else&rsquo;s decisions. The decision seemed to exist independently of anyone actually deciding anything.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was like a democratic Möbius strip - no matter which direction you followed, you always ended up back where you started.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-the-mathematics-of-progressive-budget-management">Chapter 3: The Mathematics of Progressive Budget Management</h2>
<p>The numbers, at least, were clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost of councillor allowance increases (2022-2025):</strong> Over £1 million</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/3-ealing-childrens-centres-saved-31844687">Savings</a> from closing children&rsquo;s centres:</strong> £750,000</li>
<li><strong>Council Leader&rsquo;s <a href="https://ealing.news/ealing-council/ealing-council-leader-peter-mason-massive-allowance-rise-by-over-70-along-with-increases-for-his-cabinet/">pay rise</a>:</strong> 70%</li>
<li><strong>Number of children&rsquo;s centres being closed in Southall:</strong> 3 out of 6</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Council Leader had discovered something revolutionary: you could simultaneously claim budget constraints while voting yourself substantial pay rises. The secret was treating these as completely unrelated mathematical operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to make difficult decisions due to budget pressures,&rdquo; he explained, while awarding himself £58,000 annually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you spent more on pay rises than you&rsquo;re saving,&rdquo; Mrs. Patel pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different budget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand local government finance. And we need <a href="https://www.ealingtoday.co.uk/default.asp?section=community&amp;spage=common/eacouncil220.htm">higher calibre</a> councillor candidates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-environmental-priorities---a-scientific-approach">Chapter 4: Environmental Priorities - A Scientific Approach</h2>
<p>The Council Leader&rsquo;s environmental consciousness follows a precise hierarchy, documented through his public responses:</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1 Emergency Response:</strong> Eels gasping in the River Brent receive <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/18312/to_thames_water_-_sewage_entering_into_the_river_brent.pdf">immediate action</a> [pdf) and public concern.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 2 Public Complaint:</strong> Someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;bag and/or small child&rdquo; taking up a tube seat merits a public tweet about &ldquo;Some people.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Tier 3 Busy Schedule:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/xA4mI_OAzxs">Children gasping from toxic air</a> [YouTube] in bedrooms get told &quot; <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxCUBKF53mk-J0KrZ4bxXaoAxc9iVEQhN-">I&rsquo;m very busy.</a>&rdquo; [YouTube)]</p>
<p>When five-year-old Zion asked him directly, &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/w-p6qy2RfR8">Peter, why didn&rsquo;t you help us?</a>&rdquo; [YouTube] about the gasworks poisoning, the response was so technical that Zion said it was &ldquo;too sciencey&rdquo; to understand.</p>
<p>This established a clear principle: if environmental concerns can&rsquo;t be explained to five-year-olds, they&rsquo;re probably too complex for five-year-olds to experience.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5-the-southall-paradox">Chapter 5: The Southall Paradox</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Only in Southall can carcinogenic benzene, and naphthalene - which is known to be potentially <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3850774/">fatal to some people with African and Asian heritage</a> - be released into the air from the Gasworks development at levels way <a href="https://youtu.be/CGGyCDAHRt4?si=OtAGYXGA2CQ1y3q5&amp;utm_source=MTQxZ">above legal limits</a> and be simultaneously &ldquo;not hazardous&rdquo; according to Ealing Council.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One moment the Headteacher at Blair Peach Primary School is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hB66yX40-q-YYi6EKOTvE20DTx422_g3/view?usp=drivesdk">reporting asthma and headaches</a> [p. 10] caused by very strong smells from the Gasworks site; in another moment, the developer&rsquo;s head of construction is appointed to the school&rsquo;s board of governors [pp. 7-8] and arranges to remove dead rats from the nursery playground [p. 11]. These events are clearly unconnected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all perfectly normal in Southall, where <a href="https://www.change.org/p/cleanair-for-southall-and-hayes-stop-berkeleygroupuk-s-southallwaterside-polluting-our-kids-southalllivesmatter/u/23019750">kids can be locked in class without ventilation on hot days</a> to protect them from the harmless petrol odour, and the developer&rsquo;s &ldquo;community liaison officer&rdquo; can <a href="https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1926034207492407709">simultaneously</a> be the chair of Southall&rsquo;s charity umbrella organisation, an ex-Tory tobacco salesman whose former employer <a href="https://x.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1630863285892333569">paid for our ex-MP&rsquo;s research assistant</a> to attend a jolly. Nothing to see here!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get even more interesting. The Council&rsquo;s own &ldquo;<a href="https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s1726/Southall%20Reset.pdf">Southall Reset</a>&rdquo; [pdf] document acknowledges that &ldquo;challenges of deprivation, low pay, are particularly acute&rdquo; in Southall, contributing to &ldquo;deeply embedded health and wellbeing challenges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Race Equality Commission Report &ldquo;highlighted the need for an investment in adequate primary care in Southall&rdquo; and &ldquo;deeper meaningful engagement, and better conversations with residents.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Council&rsquo;s response to this need for MORE investment? Close children&rsquo;s centres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you know we need MORE investment?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. The evidence is clear,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are you closing children&rsquo;s centres?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Budget pressures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your own report says we need more investment, not less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your report. You wrote it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Different department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Different budget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand local government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. They could officially acknowledge that Southall needed more investment while simultaneously cutting investment. They could document the problem and implement policies that made it worse. Each document existed in its own logical universe, disconnected from actual decisions.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6-the-mipim-negotiations">Chapter 6: The MIPIM Negotiations</h2>
<p>Every year, the Council Leader attends MIPIM in Cannes - what Private Eye calls a &ldquo;<a href="https://stopthetowers.info/the-mipim-jolly">booze &lsquo;n&rsquo; hookerfest</a>&rdquo; - with expenses paid by Berkeley Group, the company behind the gasworks development that&rsquo;s been poisoning Southall residents.</p>
<p>He goes to &ldquo;negotiate hard&rdquo; with developers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The documented results of these negotiations:</p>
<ul>
<li>More developments approved</li>
<li>Continued toxic air from gasworks</li>
<li>Larger councillor allowances</li>
<li>Closure of community facilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Either he&rsquo;s a remarkably poor negotiator, or &ldquo;negotiating hard&rdquo; means something different in Cannes than it does in English.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7-the-zionist-anti-zionist-synthesis">Chapter 7: The Zionist-Anti-Zionist Synthesis</h2>
<p>The Council Leader represents Southall Green - 69% BAME, one of the most ethnically diverse wards in Britain. Many of his constituents have strong views about Palestinian liberation.</p>
<p>His attitude? &ldquo;People who commit themselves to being opposed to Jewish national self determination / liberation aren&rsquo;t my cup of tea. They can exist, sure, just outside of the Labour movement.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So he simultaneously represents a diverse community while working to exclude people from that community based on their views about Middle Eastern politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a masterclass in representation: represent everyone, except the people whose politics you disagree with.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-8-the-protection-by-destruction-innovation">Chapter 8: The Protection-by-Destruction Innovation</h2>
<p>The Council Leader has pioneered a new approach to public service: protecting things by eliminating them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Govt Commissioners to slash and burn services,&rdquo; he explains, while slashing and burning services.</p>
<p>It was like watching someone slash the low-hanging fruit on the trees and then set fire to the orchard; then selling the &ldquo;infertile land&rdquo; to developers when there&rsquo;s nothing to eat.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t even the worst part. Mrs. Patel had discovered something even more troubling. Back in 2012, a group of unelected businessmen had met to play <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W2HRPD00OiidxP9iAlLPDFHPVwZcEfeM/view?usp=drivesdk">Monopoly</a> [pdf] with public assets. Not the board game - though the principle was identical. They wanted to &ldquo;sell off our public assets for £20m profit.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Their target included &ldquo;buildings used for services for vulnerable adults, children and families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they planned this years ago?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked the councillor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about that,&rdquo; the councillor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re closing children&rsquo;s centres,&rdquo; Mrs. Patel said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting services by cutting them,&rdquo; they explained patiently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made the decision to protect the front line by working with what we have, rather than allowing Government Commissioners to slash and burn services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you ARE slashing and burning services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting them by cutting them responsibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is closing them protecting them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t close them, someone else will close them worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;The Government Commissioners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they said they&rsquo;ll close them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re closing them to prevent them being closed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re protecting them by cutting them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Round and round she went, trapped in a perfectly logical system designed to make resistance impossible.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing was that everyone was telling the truth. The councillor really didn&rsquo;t know about the 2012 meeting. The 2012 meeting really had happened. The plan really was being implemented. Nobody was really in charge of implementing it.</p>
<p>Somehow, a decision made by people who didn&rsquo;t officially exist was being executed by people who officially couldn&rsquo;t stop it.
This allows him to be simultaneously the protector of services and the person closing services - a remarkable administrative innovation.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9-democracy-20---now-with-less-democracy">Chapter 9: Democracy 2.0 - Now With Less Democracy</h2>
<p>But the system&rsquo;s crowning achievement is happening right now. <strong>This month - July 2025 - Ealing Council is rewriting the petition rules</strong> in direct response to successful community campaigns.</p>
<p>On page 294 of their July 15, 2025 council <a href="https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g6611/Public%20reports%20pack%20Tuesday%2015-Jul-2025%2019.00%20Council.pdf?T=10">papers</a> [pdf, see p. 294], you can see democracy being crossed out in real time. They&rsquo;re removing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Residents' rights to ask follow-up questions</li>
<li>Requirements for senior officers to give evidence</li>
<li>Meaningful participation in debates about their own petitions</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They&rsquo;ve solved the democracy problem by removing the democratic bits from democracy.</p>
<p>The timing is perfect: after communities proved they could win by building independent pressure (Save Southall Young Adult Centre, Save Southall Town Hall, Save Warren Farm Nature Reserve), the council is changing the rules to prevent it happening again.</p>
<p>Soon residents will be able to petition - they just won&rsquo;t be able to ask questions, get answers, or participate in discussions about their concerns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s democracy in name only, which is much more efficient than the old democracy where people could actually influence things.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-10-the-southall-young-adult-centre-miracle">Chapter 10: The Southall Young Adult Centre Miracle</h2>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing - resistance is still possible. In 2022, the Council wanted to demolish Southall Young Adult Centre to build 60 flats. The usual process commenced: consultation theater, predetermined decisions, official helplessness.</p>
<p>Then the &ldquo;Save Southall Young Adult Centre&rdquo; campaign launched. They didn&rsquo;t try to work within the impossible system. They built independent pressure. They refused to accept that &ldquo;decisions had been made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They <a href="https://www.visitsouthall.co.uk/News/NewsDetails.php?recordID=1235">won</a>.</p>
<p>The centre was saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Mrs. Patel asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stopped playing by their rules,&rdquo; the organisers said. &ldquo;We built power they couldn&rsquo;t ignore.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="chapter-11-the-impossible-solution">Chapter 11: The Impossible Solution</h2>
<p>Mrs. Patel realized the children&rsquo;s centres could be saved the same way. But it would require doing something the system said was impossible: organising outside the official channels, building independent power, refusing to accept predetermined outcomes.</p>
<p>The Council had just changed the petition rules specifically to prevent another people-powered victory. But that only proved they were afraid of effective organising.</p>
<p>The system&rsquo;s weakness was its strength: it was so obviously absurd that anyone paying attention could see through it.</p>
<p>The Council Leader could tweet about putting &ldquo;people before buildings&rdquo; while closing buildings where people accessed services. He could claim to protect services while cutting them. He could represent diverse communities while excluding their political views. He could prioritize eels over children and call it environmentalism.</p>
<p>All of this was only possible because residents had been playing by rules designed to make them lose.</p>
<p>But the campaigns to save the Young Adult Centre, the Town Hall and Warren Farm proved the rules could be broken.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-12-the-choice">Chapter 12: The Choice</h2>
<p>Mrs. Patel had a choice. She could continue navigating the impossible bureaucracy, filing petitions that couldn&rsquo;t ask questions, attending consultations about predetermined decisions, lobbying councillors who claimed to have no power.</p>
<p>Or she could do what the other campaigners did: build independent power and refuse to accept defeat.</p>
<p>The children&rsquo;s centres could be saved. But only if parents stopped trying to reason with an unreasonable system and started building the power to change it.</p>
<p>The Council Leader would continue inhabiting his world of simultaneous contradictions, where closing centres meant protecting them and cutting services meant investing in communities.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Patel had learned something important: impossible things happen every day in Ealing politics.</p>
<p>If the Council Leader could be simultaneously progressive and regressive, protective and destructive, representative and exclusionary, then maybe Mrs. Patel could do something equally impossible.</p>
<p>Like save a children&rsquo;s centre.</p>
<p>The Young Adult Centre campaigners had already shown it could be done.</p>
<p>Now it was the children&rsquo;s centres' turn.</p>
<p>Mrs. Patel was beginning to understand perfectly. Even this right wing authoritarian Labour government thinks it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvj1jr0kz0o">bad idea</a> to close children&rsquo;s centres.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-13-the-engagement-paradox">Chapter 13: The Engagement Paradox</h2>
<p>The Council Leader had perfected the art of simultaneous engagement.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<h2 id="chapter-14-the-investment-paradox">Chapter 14: The Investment Paradox</h2>
<p>The Council Leader had achieved something remarkable: he could simultaneously remember genocide while investing in it. &ldquo;Remember Yesterday, Act Today,&rdquo; his council posted about the genocide of 8,732 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica thirty years ago, while <a href="https://lgpsdivest.org/lgps-investments/">investing £112 million</a> in companies enabling genocide of <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/news/2025/05/un-women-estimates-over-28000-women-and-girls-killed-in-gaza-since-october-2023">more than 28,000 women and girls</a> in Gaza today. <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unimaginable-horrors-more-50000-children-reportedly-killed-or-injured-gaza-strip">More than 50,000 children killed or injured</a> in Gaza to pay for his pension.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was beautifully efficient. Why limit yourself to one genocide when you could remember one while funding another? The children understood perfectly.</p>
<p>Equally impressive was his ability to close children&rsquo;s centres for budget reasons while sitting on the board as a <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/opdc_2020.21_audited_annual_report_and_accounts.pdf">paid director</a> [pdf] of a corporation that had just received £140 million in public funding. The logic was flawless: children&rsquo;s services were unaffordable, but corporate development was essential.</p>
<p>The Council Leader had mastered the art of proportional response. Children&rsquo;s centres closing to save £750,000? Budget pressures, difficult decisions, no choice. Sitting on the board overseeing &ldquo;one of the biggest regeneration schemes in Europe&rdquo; with £140 million in funding? That was worth £2,000 a year of his valuable time.</p>
<p>It was a masterclass in priorities: Europe&rsquo;s biggest regeneration project required his oversight, but Southall&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s centres were an unaffordable luxury.</p>
<p>He could simultaneously claim there was no money for community services while helping to plan a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/fresh-pictures-reveal-what-london-22320564">mini-Manhattan</a>&rdquo; in his own borough. The vision was clear: 54-storey towers, yes. Children&rsquo;s centres, no.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d found the perfect balance: cut services locally to save money, earn money regionally to oversee developers' profits. It was like a perpetual motion machine of fiscal responsibility.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-and-verse-the-evolution-of-enlightenment">Chapter and Verse: The Evolution of Enlightenment</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In 2010, our future Council Leader shared his frustration about &ldquo;sitting around not understanding all this punjabi&rdquo; at community meetings in the area he would later represent.</p>
<p>By 2020, he had evolved. &ldquo;Words have consequences,&rdquo; he tweeted. &ldquo;Impact is as important as intent. Culture is defined by leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ten years of personal growth had taught him that words matter. Which made it remarkable that he could simultaneously lecture about cultural sensitivity while closing community centres in the same diverse communities he&rsquo;d once struggled to understand. It was a masterclass in progressive evolution: you could acknowledge that words have consequences while ensuring your own words from the past had none.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Readers who think this is all a bit unfair, unbelievable, unhelpful or downright unlawful&hellip;</p>
<p>The most revealing evidence of how the system works came from inside the machine itself. In 2022, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hZfSB-RR7OzeCIHclKdiJd_FTnUtT7KA/view?usp=drivesdk">leaked WhatsApp messages</a> [pdf] from the Ealing Labour councillors' group chat revealed what they really thought about their leadership.</p>
<p>Mason&rsquo;s own Labour colleagues called the Council Leader &ldquo;callous, ruthless, sectarian.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They discussed votes of no confidence, referenced &ldquo;corruption and even theft&rdquo; regarding the previous leader, and debated &ldquo;bribes&rdquo; and &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; for loyalty. Meanwhile, publicly, they maintained perfect unity and collective responsibility. It was the perfect illustration of how the system works: private recognition of the problems, public performance of harmony.</p>
<p>Mrs. Patel understood perfectly. The same councillors who privately criticised authoritarian leadership accepted Mason&rsquo;s cabinet positions and pay rises to sit in silent support during council meetings.The leaked messages proved Mrs. Patel wasn&rsquo;t imagining the contradictions - even the people inside the system could see them. They just couldn&rsquo;t say so publicly.</p>

			 <p>I step out of my house and immediately notice the artificial &ldquo;cotton fresh&rdquo; scent of odour suppressants wafting south from the old Gasworks site. How can this be? They finished remediating the contaminated earth in 2019, and people have been living there in the new homes they built since 2021.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s better than the smell of petrol, which is what we had to put up with day and night for months on end in 2018. Bad enough to wake us up in the night during the long hot summer.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s better than the smell of tar, which we still get when the wind is blowing from the west. Before the asphalt plant was built, we didn&rsquo;t get any odours even though there is also a Tarmac plant nearby. The Asphalt plant owners say that is because the Nestle coffee plant closed. The (burnt?) coffee smell masked the tar.</p>
<p>I get around the corner of my block, on my morning walk, and see the small industrial estate that was the bane of our life for months in 2022. The main culprits were the paper recylcling company, which had its own incinerator for burning (believe it or not) plastics and coated wooden pallets.</p>
<p>Their neighbour opposite was a custom kitchen furniture maker, which also had its own incinerator for burning laminated particle fibreboard. The garage at the front regularly burns stuff in an old oil barrel.</p>
<p>All of which contributed to some of the most disgusting odours imaginable blowing into our kitchen, bathroom and hallway whe the wind blew from the north-east.</p>
<p>I walked down the street to the corner where the local council installed a tiny corner &ldquo;wildflower garden&rdquo;, which my wife and kids loved because it smelled so good. Two years later, it&rsquo;s reduced to a dumping ground (no one could have foreseen this).</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/dcc3f14639.jpg" alt="Auto-generated description: A pile of mattresses, wooden pallets, and other debris is stacked on a sidewalk next to a white car and a trailer."></p>
<p>Further on my walk, past the homes reeking of marijuana, and weaving in and out of the obstacle course of bed bases mattresses and pallets stren across the pavements, I reach the town and smell the food aromas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the old Honey Monster factory, which used to regale us with the smell of roasted (burnt?) onions (I know, right?).</p>
<p>And my first visit to Southall (in daylight hours), twenty odd years ago, turning left out of the old station and naively going into the underpass. The stench of piss that hit me! &ldquo;Welcome to Southall!&rdquo; indeed.</p>
<p>I finished my walk through the town and back up round and through the park. If I&rsquo;d gone further up the canal by my sons' school I would have got the smell of the narrowboats' wood-burning stoves, which sometimes fills the school playground and causes kids to have to use their inhalers.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;d walked along the main road home or by the junction with the big industrial estate I would have choked on the heavy air filled with the exhaust fumes from cars and lorries.</p>
<p>Southall stinks so bad that the council set up its own <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201283/our_neighbourhoods/2613/southall_gasworks/6">Southall Odours web page, email and hotline</a> where you can report bad smells. Because if you don&rsquo;t report it, the council can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky, you might see something done after a year or two of complaining, as long as you can withstand the constant gaslighting.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unlucky, and you&rsquo;re not already dead or too ill to complain, you&rsquo;ll be branded a troublemaker and excluded from local democracy.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;ll be told to move by the council&rsquo;s community safety director.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week I received confirmation of a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) based on results of spirometry tests back in August (it took that long for my GP surgery to get the results from the test centre, and only after my own intervention after their repeated failures).</p>
<p>My GP helpfully seemed very keen to blame my twenty-odd year history of smoking.</p>
<p>I first smoked at about age 20. My parents were smokers (wasn&rsquo;t everyone back then?). I was never a heavy smoker. The most I ever smoked was ten a day. It&rsquo;s also true I smoked a number of other substances that didn&rsquo;t come with filters. And then there was some vaping. I suspect that might have been the worst of the lot, but who knows? I haven&rsquo;t smoked for ten years.</p>
<p>In my childhood, I remember several episodes of severe shortness of breath, e.g., when running around the sports field at primary school I collapsed gasping for breath, and unable to continue. I was never diagnosed with asthma. I was told to get up and stop being so weak.</p>
<p>As I got older, whenever the football season started, I could never get through a full game. I put it down to lack of fitness and stamina at the time, but whatever it was, the symptom was breathlessness. I was told to get fit and sent off on cross-country runs.</p>
<p>I had regular episodes of shortness of breath throughout young adulthood that were not triggered by exercise (I&rsquo;d more or less given up by then, helped by a dodgy ankle). I thought it might be hayfever or a dust allergy.</p>
<p>Fourteen years ago, I needed a thoracotomy on my right lung after a chest infection went wrong. I developed pleurisy, a collapsed lung and an empyema. In the post-op, my surgeon said my lung was &ldquo;as good as new&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the years before covid, I had frequent chest infections requiring antibiotics and time off work to recover. Then and now, I wonder if that was triggered by the <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2024/10/29/the-southall-gasworks.html">Southall Gasworks</a> remediation and air pollution?</p>
<p>I now see that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-67210-7">studies show</a> that exposure to volatile organic compounds (including benzene, naphthalene and toluene) is related to COPD.</p>
<p>The good news is that I had no symptoms of COPD, so it&rsquo;s been diagnosed at an early stage. I&rsquo;ve started with my new inhaler, and my wife reports that I&rsquo;ve stopped snoring.</p>

			 <p>Ealing Genocide Supporters Club (aka Ealing Labour Party) held their Southall Branch meeting yesterday at the Dominion Centre in Southall. Under the guise of a &ldquo;Your Town, Your Voice&rdquo; community get together, our local elected repellents gathered on masse in all their finery. I couldn&rsquo;t help myself as they posed for a group photo all gurning inanely as the photographer encouraged them to &ldquo;say cheese!&rdquo;. &ldquo;Say genocide!&rdquo; I offered. &ldquo;Genocide supporters!&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Cllr Dr Murtaza of their number aggressively reprimanded me. &ldquo;What evidence do you have that we support genocide?&rdquo; he demanded to know. Well, I told him, my main piece of evidence would be that you have done nothing to oppose it.</p>
<p>Ooh! There&rsquo;s Cllr Martin! Our locally elected anti-Traveller racist! &ldquo;What evidence do you have to support that?&rdquo; Well, <a href="https://skwawkbox.org/2022/02/14/party-imposed-london-council-candidate-used-holocaust-language-against-gypsy-roma-travellers/">here</a> it is.</p>
<p>Oh, and while you&rsquo;re at it, Cllr Dr Murtaza. Next time you are chauffeuring our glorious leader around in your Porsche, try not to <a href="https://twitter.com/DvdMrsdn/status/1587711673942646785?t=U0luZmPHCxRb9wGAC5Ffkw&amp;s=19">park in a cycle lane</a>, please.</p>
<p>Then there was illegal samosa factory proprietor Cllr <a href="https://sadealing.blogspot.com/2010_10_03_archive.html?m=1">&ldquo;I own half of Southall&rdquo;</a> Anand.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t realised until yesterday quite how visceral my revulsion for these people is. The grand <a href="https://ealing.nub.news/news/local-news/former-ealing-council-housing-leader-admits-he-39made-a-mistake39-accepting-3000-from-developer-for-cannes-property-conference">cuckoo in the nest</a> arrived about half way through the event. I would have confronted him myself, and previously I have done. Maybe I was just worn down from a week with the &lsquo;flu, but I felt like I really had to keep my distance for my own sanity. In any case, a few council officers made beelines for me and made sure I was busy answering their questions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Interestingly, one officer suggested to me that resident-led ward forums would be the likely outcome of this event. Fantastic news, if that&rsquo;s the case. Another officer I spoke to later, knew nothing about this idea, though, but took copious notes. A neighbour and friend told me that she spoke to the cuckoo himself who told her that this meeting was in fact the replacement for he old (councillor-led) ward forums. That&rsquo;s that then.</p>
<p>The event itself was a repeat of several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040615012717/http://www.southallgasworks.com/Media/ConsultationReport.pdf">resident</a>[pdf] <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/6838/southall_shaping_ealing_summary">surveys</a> and <a href="https://www.visitsouthall.co.uk/News/NewsDetails.php?recordID=1006">failed</a> <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/6999/southall_reset_%E2%80%93_spatial_planning_framework">plans</a> over the past twenty years or so (for which I&rsquo;ve seen records, or taken part in). The problems are always the same. The responses from the council are always the same. Nothing.</p>

			 <p>This was survey feedback given to developers proposing to build a massive data centre on the site of the industrial estate down the road from me, but it applies more broadly to all big developers, especially those with annual profits of half a billion pounds.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned about noise from the site causing a nuisance and health problems in an area that is already susceptible to multiple environmental health stressors, and exacerbated by deep-rooted poverty, deprivation, low pay and systemic racism and power imbalances embedded in the local authority planning system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also concerned about the local power grid. Only a couple of years ago it was reported that Ealing doesn&rsquo;t have enough capacity to power more new homes that are so badly needed, particularly in Southall which suffers from chronic overcrowding. A data centre requires a lot of power. How will this work?</p>
<p>If you really want to do something for the local community how about you plant thousands of trees to compensate for the fact that Southall has the lowest tree canopy cover in the whole of Ealing?</p>
<p>How about building homes for the street homeless and providing ongoing support they will need to live in them sustainably?</p>
<p>How about building a drug and alcohol rehab unit to treat the ever growing numbers of addicts roaming our streets and parks?</p>
<p>How about using all that information processing power to work out how to provide more frequent, more reliable, free public transport in Southall and to reduce the congestion caused by all the traffic?</p>
<p>How about building a secular community centre, a library, a youth club, a health centre, a school? Southall is so overdeveloped now, and Ealing Labour Council sold off all our community assets to developers.</p>

			 <p>ToryBoy The Movie is the account of filmmaker John Walsh&rsquo;s disillusionment with what he saw as the corruption, lies, hypocrisy and general incompetence of Blair&rsquo;s Labour government, and his conversion to the Conservative (Tory) Party general election candidate for Middlesbrough in 2010.</p>
<p>Under his own steam and £15,000 of his own money, John found his opponent, Sir Stuart Bell, the serial incumbent Labour MP, invisible and unknown to his local constituents who nevertheless voted him back in every four or five years (albeit with an ever diminishing majority). Bell was too busy, it seemed, living in Paris, and employing his family not to answer phone calls at his parliamentary office. Worse, his son stole £8,000 worth of stuff from Bell&rsquo;s parliamentary colleagues, eventually serving sixty days in prison for the privilege.</p>
<p>Despite this record of failure, Bell was duly elected again, with Walsh coming in third behind the newly Nick Clegg-revitalised Lib Dems.</p>
<p>Last year, I had my own attempt to counter what I (and many others) saw as corruption, lies, hypocrisy and general incompetence of our local elected councillors. Standing as independent candidates, me and my two friends came fourth in the safest Labour ward in Ealing. It was good fun campaigning, and I enjoyed the physical activity of walking almost every street in my ward dropping leaflets, and the social activity of actually talking to people in person. And we helped to reduce  Labour&rsquo;s vote share and majority (not that it makes any difference to the result).</p>
<p>Still, people voted in their thousands for two councillors who have been in post for twenty four years each, while the problems everyone complains about are the same but worse.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it was another failure to add to my CV.</p>

<p>The health risks from remediating Southall Gasworks on site in the open air are significant. The site is highly contaminated with a variety of hazardous chemicals, including benzene, naphthalene, VOCs, PAHs, heavy metals, &ldquo;blue billy&rdquo; and asbestos. These chemicals can cause a variety of health problems, including cancer, respiratory problems, neurological problems, and birth defects. The local community is mostly of south Asian and African heritage, and it is known that people with this heritage can be genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. This means that they are more likely to experience health problems from exposure to naphthalene.</p>
<p>If levels of benzene and naphthalene are consistently above the legal safety guidelines, and local residents complain of eye, nose and throat irritation, new or worsening of respiratory conditions and infections, or other health problems as a result of odour and air pollution, the developer and regulatory authorities should take immediate action to protect the health of the community. This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stopping the remediation work until the levels of contamination can be brought down to safe levels.</li>
<li>Providing air filters and other protective equipment to residents who live near the site.</li>
<li>Evacuation of residents who are most at risk.</li>
<li>Conducting a health study of the community to assess the impact of the contamination.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer and regulatory authorities have a responsibility to protect the health of the community. If they fail to take action, they could be held liable for any health problems that result from the contamination.</p>
<p>Here are some additional information about the health risks of the chemicals found at Southall Gasworks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benzene:</strong> Benzene is a colorless, flammable liquid that is used in a variety of products, including gasoline, paints, and solvents. It is a known carcinogen, and it can also cause leukemia, anemia, and other health problems.</li>
<li><strong>Naphthalene:</strong> Naphthalene is a white, crystalline solid that is used in mothballs and other products. It is also a known carcinogen, and it can cause respiratory problems, skin irritation, and other health problems.</li>
<li><strong>VOCs:</strong> Volatile organic compounds are a group of chemicals that can easily evaporate into the air. They can come from a variety of sources, including gasoline, paints, and solvents. VOCs can cause a variety of health problems, including respiratory problems, headaches, nausea, and cancer.</li>
<li><strong>PAHs:</strong> Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed when organic matter is burned. They are found in a variety of sources, including gasoline, coal, and tobacco smoke. PAHs can cause cancer, respiratory problems, and other health problems.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy metals:</strong> Heavy metals are a group of metals that are toxic to humans and other animals. They can come from a variety of sources, including mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. Heavy metals can cause a variety of health problems, including cancer, neurological problems, and birth defects.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Blue billy&rdquo;:</strong> Blue billy is a type of asbestos that is found in coal tar. Asbestos is a known carcinogen, and it can cause a variety of health problems, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that the health risks of exposure to these chemicals vary depending on the level of exposure, the length of exposure, and the individual&rsquo;s health. If you are concerned about your health after being exposed to these chemicals, you should see a doctor.</p>

<li><strong>Publicly apologize to the residents of Ealing for your actions.</strong> Acknowledge that you have made a mistake and that you are truly sorry for the harm that you have caused.</li>
<li><strong>Refund the developer all of the gifts and hospitality that you have accepted.</strong> This will demonstrate that you are serious about addressing the conflict of interest and that you are committed to acting in the best interests of the residents of Ealing.</li>
<li><strong>Work with the developer to find a solution to the air pollution problem.</strong> This may involve additional odour suppression measures, compensation for residents who have been harmed by the air pollution, or other measures.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure that residents have a way to report air pollution problems quickly and easily.</strong> This could involve setting up a dedicated hotline or website, or making it easier for residents to contact the council.</li>
<li><strong>Investigate all reports of air pollution promptly and thoroughly.</strong> This will help to ensure that residents are taken seriously and that their concerns are addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the public informed about the progress of your efforts to address the air pollution problem.</strong> This will help to build trust and confidence between the council and the residents of Ealing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What you should not do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not deny or downplay the seriousness of the air pollution problem.</strong> The residents of Ealing are suffering, and they deserve to be taken seriously.</li>
<li><strong>Do not try to cover up your conflict of interest.</strong> The public has a right to know about any potential conflicts of interest that could affect the way you make decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Do not try to blame the developer or anyone else for the air pollution problem.</strong> As the leader of Ealing Council, you are ultimately responsible for the health and safety of the residents of your borough.</li>
<li><strong>Do not give up on finding a solution to the air pollution problem.</strong> The residents of Ealing deserve to live in a clean and healthy environment, and you have a responsibility to do everything you can to make that happen.</li>

			 <p>Ealing Council&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7039/ealing_council_air_quality_strategy_2020-30">draft Air Quality Strategy</a> is a 64 page document together with a 40 page <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/7038/ealing_draft_air_quality_action_plan_2022-2027">Action Plan</a>, and the consultation period runs until 30 January 2023. It&rsquo;s taken me the best part of six weeks, all my spare time over Christmas and New Year, to get through it all, make notes and cross-reference to try to make sense of it all and offer some feedback.</p>
<p>Really, there must be a much longer consultation period if Ealing Council is genuinely interested in residents' views.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of what the key points of interest are for me, and in particular in relation to Southall, where I live and work. My additional suggestions are <strong>in bold</strong>, and my comments and questions in <em>italics</em>.</p>
<h4 id="warning">Warning</h4>
<p>This is a LONG post. I&rsquo;ve tried to break it into sections to make it easier to read.</p>
<h4 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h4>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t claim to be an expert, other than through experience. I am just an ordinary resident living in the midst of four major industrial and construction site polluters for several years. I have campaigned alongside my family, neighbours and friends for clean air after my then nearly four year old said he wanted fresh air not stinky air. He&rsquo;d been hospitalised three times when he was two and diagnosed with asthma. We soon discovered people who had lost loved ones, had heart attacks, ectopic pregnancies, cancer, all attributed to the foul petrochemical stink.</em></p>
<p><em>I welcome any corrections.</em></p>
<h1 id="my-summary">My Summary</h1>
<p><strong>If Ealing is serious about &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; inequalities, action must be targeted to protect vulnerable people in Southall to reduce air pollution and its impact on the health of its large, mostly economically deprived and non-white population.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Strategy and Plan must target children and older people, people with lung conditions, and pregnant women: outside schools and school run hours. The Council must question if it is ethical to promote active travel in Southall when it knows that it is a high pollution area and that most of its population is particularly vulnerable to its adverse health impacts.</strong></p>
<p>The draft strategy and action plan don&rsquo;t do this at all.</p>

<p><em>To begin, I think it’s fantastic that Ealing Council has stated its vision for clean air for all Ealing residents, in alignment with that of local residents’ campaign group <a href="https://southallandhayescleanair.org.uk/about/" title="About page for campaign group Clean Air for Southall and Hayes">Clean Air for Southall and Hayes</a> (CASH).</em></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-strategy-and-action-plan">Summary of the Strategy and Action Plan</h2>
<p>Ealing&rsquo;s draft air quality strategy&rsquo;s five stated priorities are to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduce road traffic emissions</li>
<li>Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning</li>
<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments</li>
<li>Invest in green infrastructure</li>
<li>Raise awareness of air quality</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>It would be useful to see the strategy and action plan follow the same structure with clear definitions of terms, and specific and detailed aims and objectives for each priority, along with baseline air pollution levels and equalities data for each in order to monitor and measure impact.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/1629717036.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing six areas for action: Emissions from Developments and Buildings; Public health and awareness raising; Delivery servicing and freight; Borough fleet actions; Localised solutions; Cleaner transport"></p>
<p>Somewhat confusingly, the action plan groups its actions into six categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Emissions from Developments and Buildings</li>
<li>Public health and awareness raising</li>
<li>Delivery servicing and freight</li>
<li>Borough fleet actions</li>
<li>Localised solutions</li>
<li>Cleaner transport</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This maybe because they are copied and pasted from the previous <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/4240/air_quality_action_plan_aqap">2017-22 action plan</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>It would be better for understanding, monitoring and evaluation to have consistency and coherence between the two documents, updating the action plan where necessary to reflect this.</strong></p>
<p>Also somewhat confusingly, Ealing&rsquo;s draft air quality strategy has nine stated goals, starting with the obvious. I&rsquo;ll say more on these later:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Improve air quality</li>
<li>Tackling the climate crisis</li>
<li>Fighting inequality</li>
<li>Protect biodiversity</li>
<li>Protect health and wellbeing</li>
<li>Raise public awareness</li>
<li>Promote sustainable infrastructure</li>
<li>Support the transition to clean energy</li>
<li>Creating good jobs</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inequalities">Inequalities</h3>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/17f94db6cd.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on inequalities and inclusivity of people who are unable to reduce their pollution footprint"></p>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk in Ealing&rsquo;s air quality strategy about being inclusive and &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; (&ldquo;reducing&rdquo; would be better?) inequalities, and recognising that not everyone will be able to reduce their own air pollution &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; (&ldquo;exhaust trail&rdquo; might be more apt?). I&rsquo;m not convinced that the strategy actually does this consistently, if at all. More on this later.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="public-health-policy">Public Health Policy</h3>
<p>The strategy sets out how it fits into national, regional and local policy frameworks.</p>
<p><em>When I first read the strategy, I felt it fell very much within an environmental policy framework (which in Ealing seems to come under the <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Cabinet portfolio for Climate Action</a>), with its focus on reducing air pollution, and as we&rsquo;ll see later, promoting active travel.</em></p>
<p>In contrast, the draft action plan is explicitly a legally required document that falls directly within a public health policy framework (Ealing&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Healthy Lives cabinet portfolio</a>).</p>
<p>*There&rsquo;s obviously a good deal of crossover between the two, and other policy frameworks and cabinet portfolios, too, not least of which is housing policy (or <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Good Growth</a>), and social policy (<a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201044/councillors/567/cabinet" title="Ealing Council Cabinet portfolios">Tackling Inequalities</a>).</p>
<p><strong>It would be useful to see this joint responsibility formally recognised in both the strategy and the action plan, too. This work is important, and there needs to be joint working and accountability.</strong></p>
<p>The strategy goes on to make the case for why air pollution is bad and needs to be reduced. The headline figure that around 150 people die every year in Ealing due to long-term exposure to toxic air is not insignificant.</p>
<p><em>Ealing&rsquo;s <a href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profiles/2019/E09000009.html?area-name=Ealing">Health Profile from 2019</a> puts that figure in some context:</em></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/35109e01b4.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Ealing&rsquo;s 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer" title="Screenshot of Ealing's 2019 Health Profile showing mortality counts for different causes of death, e.g., 819 deaths from cancer"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="air-pollution-in-ealing">Air Pollution in Ealing</h2>
<h3 id="pollution-sources">Pollution Sources</h3>
<p>The strategy states that the two worst air pollutants in Ealing are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Short and long-term and/or frequent exposure to high levels of both can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and throat, and cause or worsen heart and lung disease in children and adults, and reduce life expectancy.</p>
<p>Those most vulnerable to the adverse health effects of toxic air are children, older people, people with pre-existing lung disease (e.g., asthma), and pregnant women.</p>
<p><strong>It would be sensible and ethical for the strategy and action plan to focus on reducing air pollution in and outside schools, sheltered housing, residential and nursing homes, and in and around identified local air pollution &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo;, especially where these are located in areas of known multiple inequalities (e.g., Southall).</strong></p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t believe the strategy or the action plan really does this at all.</em></p>
<p>The strategy explains in further detail what the main sources of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 are in the borough.</p>
<p><em>Again there is what appears to me, to be some inconsistency about sources and their health effects within the same document. For example, on page 19 there is a graphic showing that wood burning is a source of particulate matter (PM2.5 - 20%, data from 2019).</em></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/adc0267e1f.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing 20% of PM2.5 emissions caused by wood-burning"></p>
<p><em>On page 11, another graphic suggest that wood burning is a source of nitrogen dioxide (but not particulater matter):</em></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/12c505256e.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing wood-burning as a source of nitrogen dioxide, but not particulate matter"></p>
<p><em>In the graphics from the 2017-22 action plan, wood burning doesn&rsquo;t get a look-in at all, data from 2013.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f0df8bd46e.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together" title="Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan: graphic showing sources of PM2.5 emissions excludes wood-burning all together"></p>
<p><strong>It would be useful for the strategy to have clarity and consistency on air pollution sources.</strong></p>
<p><em>The good news is that road traffic emissions, the council&rsquo;s key action area for 2022-30, reduced significantly in Ealing between 2013 and 2019.</em></p>
<p><strong>It would be useful if the strategy could make clear and explain how the reduction in road traffic emissions between 2013-19 happened.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="air-quality-monitoring">Air Quality Monitoring</h3>
<p>The strategy notes the air quality targets set by European Union, United Kingdom and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline limits.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/0996242a03.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy: graphic showing air quality guideline limits set by the EU, UK and WHO"></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s worth noting here (and in the strategy), that, as things stand, the <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/pm2.5_in_london_october19.pdf" title="PDF">background levels of PM2.5</a> in London (i.e., particulate matter that comes into the borough from outside Ealing and even from abroad) is around double the WHO&rsquo;s target.</em></p>
<p>The draft strategy document continues by identifying the areas in Ealing worst affected by air pollution from nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. There are eight Air Quality Focus Areas, including one in Southall covering South Road (remember the name), The Green, King Street and Western Road.</p>
<p>Ealing has 67 air quality monitors across the borough, all recording levels of nitrogen dioxide, but only four measure particulate matter (PM10 only).</p>
<p><em>It seems remiss not to have more PM10 monitors, or to have any PM2.5 monitors (although there are three NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 monitors around the Southall Gasworks site, rather erroneously remarketed as <a href="https://www.airqualityengland.co.uk/local-authority/?la_id=191" title="Air Quality England: Southall monitors">The Green Quarter</a>.</em></p>
<p>Ealing publishes annual air quality <a href="https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/Reports.aspx">status reports</a>.</p>
<p><em>Ealing also has <a href="https://www.ealingair.org.uk/AirQuality/DiffusionTubes.aspx">an interactive map showing all its NO2 diffusion tube monitoring sites</a> where you can see graphical annual data summary charts. Unfortunately, none seem to have been updated since 2021.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/58dfd151de.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021" title="Screenshot of a graphic of a monitoring site in Southall showing annual data up to 2021"></p>
<p><strong>It would be useful to have more monitors for particulate matter, especially PM2.5, across the borough, and in Southall, and for published data from all air pollution monitors to be kept accessible and up-to-date.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="priorities-for-action">Priorities for Action</h2>
<p>Back to the strategy&rsquo;s priorities for action, and my <em>comments and questions</em>, and <strong>suggestions</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduce road traffic emissions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The biggest reduction in road traffic emissions came during 2020 covid lockdowns, and while it&rsquo;s not practical, feasible or desirable to replicate that going forward, it might be worth promoting the idea that employers should encourage and support an increase to the 36% of Ealing&rsquo;s working age population already mainly <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/work/distance-travelled-to-work/workplace-travel-5a/works-mainly-from-home?lad=E09000009" title="2021 Census data on working from home in Ealing">working from home</a> whenever possible, as opposed to the current political groupthink that everyone must return to the office in order to be productive.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improve indoor air quality and reduce emissions from wood-burning.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>There are two wood-burning incinerators close to my home, which frequently create disgusting burning plastic odours forcing us to stay indoors and close all our windows. Not very good for healthy lives or improving indoor air quality, and the Council&rsquo;s response to mine and my neighbours’ complaints has been infuriatingly slow and unhelpful. It doesn&rsquo;t give me much confidence that the council really believes all these fine words about reducing air pollution and improving health outcomes when it comes to enforcement action.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduce emissions from construction of new developments.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Wouldn&rsquo;t this be fantastic?! Again, the Council&rsquo;s response to the Southall Gasworks poisoning has been shameful, and bears no resemblance to its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan pledges to reduce emissions and enforce construction management plans. How can we have any confidence that the council will put residents' needs for clean air first, and above developers' desires to enrich themselves and their shareholders by cutting corners by compromising the health and quality of life of the most vulnerable population in the borough already faced with multiple inequalities?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Invest in green infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Southall has the least <a href="https://www.ealingitree.online/stories/canopy-cover/0" title="Tree canopy cover in Ealing">tree canopy cover in Ealing</a>, yet is subjected to <a href="https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns" title="Over-development of Southall">massive overdevelopment</a>. This almost entirely terraced town is being transformed into a new Manhattan.</em></p>
<p><em>The one concession negotiated hard by our elected representatives, and granted by the London Mayor for overruling local democracy to allow the Gasworks development, was to widen the South Road bridge by the train station to ease the often gridlocked road. Now, the Council Leader has undemocratically pressed the &lsquo;reset&rsquo; button. Having sat on the Mayor&rsquo;s money and done nothing for so long it&rsquo;s no longer nearly enough to do the necessary work. We are promised £9.5m worth of cycle lanes, a tiny new &lsquo;pocket park&rsquo; outside Lidl on the High Street, and a couple of mini-&lsquo;orchards&rsquo; planted in existing parks, instead. And we have the &lsquo;Poison Park&rsquo; to look forward to, the &lsquo;green space&rsquo; crafted by Berkeley Group from the contaminated old Gasworks land.</em></p>
<p><strong>If the council&rsquo;s air quality strategy is to have any real meaning and intent to address air pollution and multiple inequalities in the Southall Air Quality Focus Area and beyond, it must surely include a vast tree-planting project, and proper maintenance of our existing parks if no new ones can be created on non-contaminated land.</strong></p>
<p><em>Instead, the council Leader has undemocratically proposed a &lsquo;compromise&rsquo; to <a href="https://ealing.news/environment/environmentalists-tell-ealing-council-and-its-leader-peter-mason-their-actions-will-result-in-ecocide-and-are-environmentally-reckless-and-ecologically-illiterate-over-warren-farm-sports-p" title="Ealing News coverage of Warren Farm story">destroy most of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall</a> in order to build new sports pitches that the vast majority of local people he consulted don&rsquo;t want. I don&rsquo;t understand how the Leader&rsquo;s desires complement the Council&rsquo;s stated strategies to reduce air pollution, tackle the climate emergency they declared, and to protect and promote biodiversity and our ecosystem.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Raise awareness of air quality.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The council also wants to (and must) lead by example.</em></p>
<p><strong>If the council really wants to lead by example on reducing air pollution, then the council Leader cannot accept or request car rides to or from meetings in Southall, councillors cannot park in cycle lanes in Southall, nor fly to the property developer festival in the south of France. They must engage with Southall residents suffering the worst of the air pollution from multiple sources, and stop denying or minimising the existence and extent of the problems, and proactively and collaboratively work to reduce or stop such pollution episodes continuing.</strong></p>
<p><em>Otherwise, the council&rsquo;s strategy isn&rsquo;t worth the virtual paper it&rsquo;s printed on, and is just more hot air.</em></p>
<p><em>What we have in the draft plan, however, is largely a copy-and-paste of the previous 2017-2022 plan, which was, at worst, a demonstrable failure of ambition, leadership and political will, and, at best, a simple failure of the council to do what it said it would do.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="strategy-goals">Strategy Goals</h2>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Improve air quality. Protect the health and wellbeing of Ealing residents from the harmful effects
of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) air pollution.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The strategy MUST have the inclusive goal of protecting residents from the harmful effects of ALL air pollutants (not just nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter).</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Tackling the climate crisis&hellip;. by aiming for the highest environmental standards.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The &ldquo;highest environmental standards&rdquo; must be clearly stated and defined.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Fighting inequality&hellip;. to ensure that no-one is left behind&hellip; [and] residents feel safe.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The strategy must ensure that inequalities are reduced, that ALL residents are included in this process, and that their concerns for the safety of their air are taken seriously and acted upon.</strong> <em>Promoting the uptake of expensive electric vehicles and discounting parking spaces for them is discriminating against economically deprived mostly non-white people who suffer most from air pollution.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Protect biodiversity. Ensuring our parks, open spaces and nature are protected and enhanced.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This is particularly relevant right now, as the Council Leader pushes on with his undemocratic desire to destroy much of the already rewilded Warren Farm Nature Reserve in Southall, and killing off a quarter of London&rsquo;s endangered skylarks, in order to build new sports pitches and/or a football stadium.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Protect health and wellbeing. Protecting and enhancing the physical and mental health of all.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Except in Southall? <a href="https://www.ealing.gov.uk/downloads/download/5214/public_health_england_-_southall_waterside_interim_health_risk_assessment">Public Health England&rsquo;s four risk assessment reports</a> into the Southall Gasworks poisoning clearly stated that &ldquo;Odours can cause nuisance amongst the population possibly leading to stress and anxiety. Some people may experience symptoms such as nausea, headaches or dizziness.&quot;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>Raise public awareness. Promoting awareness of the causes and impacts of air quality issues, as well as the available local solutions&hellip;. encouraging community activism&hellip;.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Except in Southall? At every opportunity, Ealing Council has sought to erase, deny or minimise the causes and impacts of air quality issues related to Southall Gasworks, refused to enforce any local solutions, and actively discouraged and attempted to prevent community activists' voices from being heard.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>Promote sustainable infrastructure. Ensure local transport and development planning supports investment in sustainable infrastructure, that limits impact on air quality, enabling a shift to low-emission transport and energy options.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Except in Southall? The Council recently <a href="https://ealing.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s1726/Southall%20Reset.pdf">decided NOT to widen the South Road bridge in Southall</a>. Widening the bridge, as promised, would ease congestion, and improve air quality, public transport and active travel options. The bridge widening was the one concession granted to the Southall community when the London Mayor overruled local democracy to give the go ahead to development of the highly contaminated Southall Gasworks site.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>Support the transition to clean energy. Supporting the uptake of low-emission energy technologies and improvements in efficiencies, and reducing reliance on the consumption of fossil and solid fuels.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/14/electric-cost-lithium-mining-decarbonasation-salt-flats-chile" title="Guardian article about the environmental cost of lithium mining in Chile">in Chile</a>? Simply promoting and encouraging more (low emission) cars isn’t going to reduce congestion, emissions from brake and tyre wear, or help to reduce our “reliance on the consumption of fossil fuels”. Ealing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-62346322" title="BBC News story about electricity grid in Ealing not having enough capacity to power new home developments until 2030">reportedly doesn’t have enough power on the electricity grid for new homes until 2030</a>.</em></p>

<li>Creating good jobs. We want to&hellip; deliver an ambitious programme of building more genuinely affordable homes.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Ealing is <a href="https://ealingperformance.inphase.com/Detail/865_11844" title="Ealing Council's own performance dashboard">building fewer genuinely affordable homes than ever</a>, and <a href="https://davidmarsden.info/2022/12/16/the-property-lobby.html" title="My own review of Bob Colenutt's book The Property Lobby in relation to developments in Ealing">making the housing crisis in Ealing worse</a> by <a href="https://ealing.news/ealing-council/concerns-raised-as-ealing-council-demolishes-more-social-rented-homes-than-any-other-london-local-authority/" title="Ealing News coverage of social homes demolished by London councils">demolishing more social rent homes</a> than it is building.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="spotlight-on-southall">Spotlight on Southall</h2>
<p>These are all my comments, so I&rsquo;m not putting it all in <em>italics.</em></p>
<p>My suggestions and questions for the strategy are still in <strong>bold.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Southall cannot be used as a good example of how Ealing Council takes air pollution seriously.</strong></p>
<h3 id="inequalities-1">Inequalities</h3>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b507cd1558.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the inequity of exposure to air pollution for non-white poor people"></p>
<p>Southall has a <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/identity/ethnic-group/ethnic-group-tb-20b/white-english-welsh-scottish-northern-irish-or-british?lad=E09000009" title="2021 Census data">BAME population of more than 90%</a>.</p>
<p>Southall Broadway/West and Southall Green are the two council wards that border the old Gasworks site, and which are downwind from the FM Conway asphalt and Tarmac plants, and the two wood-burning incinerators, depending on wind direction. They are connected by the Gasworks site and by the Air Quality Focus Area from South Road to The Green, King Street and Western Road.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/620d0a35d2.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the additive impact of air pollution from development sites"></p>
<p>Southall is already a high pollution area (and an Air Quality Focus Area as a result), but has several additive sources of unmitigated, uncontrolled air pollution.</p>
<p>Economically poorer, BAME people, children, older people and pregnant women are the most vulnerable to the health impacts of toxic air pollution. Certainly not a fairer start for Southall’s children.</p>
<p>We know from bitter experience over the last six years in Southall that the council has failed in its duty to protect some of its most vulnerable residents from harm.</p>
<h3 id="raising-awareness">Raising Awareness</h3>
<p>To add insult to injury, the council failed to raise public awareness of the risks and the air quality monitoring data in an open and transparent manner before work on the site began, and while the work was in progress. It was only thanks to local residents and CASH campaigners that a Public Meeting was held in 2019, and it was only then that Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged that some people with African and South Asian heritage are genetically vulnerable to naphthalene poisoning. PHE stated that “levels of naphthalene [at the Gasworks site] must be urgently reduced”. Residents were never informed if, when or how levels of naphthalene were urgently reduced.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/7ee1493a47.jpg" alt="Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council&rsquo;s statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment" title="Screenshot from an Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment"></p>
<p>It’s noteworthy that the Council claims it asked PHE to get involved only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031045353/https://www.ealing.gov.uk/news/article/2035/statement_on_phe_southall_waterside_risk_assessment" title="Internet Archive page of Ealing Council's statement on PHE Southall Waterside Risk Assessment">“following concerns raised by local residents”</a> and not because the Council itself carried out an Equalities Impact Assessment prior to works starting in 2016, knowing that the Southall population was significantly more vulnerable to air pollution due to high pre-existing levels and multiple inequalities.</p>
<p>Similarly, the council says it responded to residents' concerns by installing &ldquo;independent&rdquo; air quality monitors on site in 2021, but this is five years after the work started, and two years after the main source of air pollution and odour complaints (the so-called soil &ldquo;hospital&rdquo;) was decommissioned. The monitors now installed record near-real time data for “urban background” emissions of odourless particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/76615b310f.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy commissioning independent air quality monitoring in response to residents' concerns"></p>
<p>The odours and air pollution that residents are concerned about originate from polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (i.e., the hundred years’ of toxic waste from town gas, coal tar and petrochemical work sites). We are told that there are diffusion tubes monitoring these emissions, but there is a total lack of openness and transparency as to their locations and the data they have recorded. The council has refused to answer the most basic questions (e.g., what chemical or chemicals causes the odour of petrol? What level of this chemical or chemicals in the air is detectable by the human nose?) So much for raising public awareness!</p>
<h3 id="public-health">Public Health</h3>
<p>We are also told that the emissions from the site are not harmful to health (this despite hundreds of residents reporting that they have suffered ill-health as a result), so it is surprising that the council then spent £200,000 (albeit paid for by Berkeley Group) on these monitors. <strong>Is the air pollution from Southall Gasworks harmful to health, or not?</strong> The money would have been better spent on statutory nuisance enforcement. Why did Berkeley Group agree to pay for these monitors?</p>
<p>Moreover, the council must have known in 2016 that the economically poorer, mostly BAME population of Southall carried a higher burden of risk to the potential ill-effects of a hundred years' of highly contaminated toxic waste being dug up and &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; in the open air in the middle of a densely populated residential area. <strong>Why wasn&rsquo;t truly independent (i.e., not paid for by the perpetrators Berkeley) air quality monitoring put in place before work started (to record a baseline), and open and transparent near-real time data published so that residents could see for themselves the reality of what they were forced to breathe night and day for the best part of two and a half years?</strong></p>
<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the council force Berkeley Group to stop work and make the site safe in the three month heatwave of 2018 when residents pleaded with the council leader, local councillors and Member of Parliament to do so?</p>
<p>The council failed to act on enforcing the construction management plan (CMP) at Southall Gasworks. Indeed half of the plan was missing from the planning portal and <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/845384/response/2020637/attach/html/5/FOI%20Response%2022%200363%20FINAL.pdf.html" title="Freedom of Information Response from Ealing Council stating they don't have a copy of the original CMP for Southall Gasworks">the council admitted that it didn&rsquo;t have a full copy of the original CMP</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How on earth was the council planning to enforce a CMP it wasn’t in possession of?</strong> This was a gross dereliction of duty to care for the health and wellbeing of (by its own definition) the most vulnerable residents in the borough.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/43138639f4.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites" title="Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan committing to full enclosure of waste sites"></p>
<p><strong>The Council was committed to full enclosure of waste sites in its 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan. Why wasn’t the one hundred years of petrochemical waste &ldquo;soil cleaning hospital” enclosed?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.southallgasholders.com/" title="National Grid's website for the Southall Gasholders detailing their use of a soil cleaning enclosure">National Grid have enclosed their enclosed their soil remediation work</a> specifically to avoid causing odour nuisance to the local community (and thanks no doubt to campaigning by local residents and activists at Clean Air for Southall and Hayes).</p>
<h3 id="on-whose-side">On Whose Side?</h3>
<p>Why did the former and current council leader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181229123356/http://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Councillors/tabid/63/ctl/ViewCMIS_Person/mid/383/id/19/ScreenMode/Alphabetical/Default.aspx" title="Internet Archive page of former Ealing Council Leader Julian Bell's declarations of gifts and hospitality from developers">accept over £30,000 in gifts and hospitality from developers including Berkeley Group</a> to fly (!) to the south of France for what Private Eye Magazine describes as <a href="https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/dispatches-from-cannes-46501" title="Inside Housing article on the MIPIM property festival and Private Eye Magazine's description of it as a booze and hookerfest">a booze and hookerfest</a>?</p>
<p>The new council leader claims he went there to negotiate hard. If that&rsquo;s the case, what did he negotiate? He also claimed that it wasn&rsquo;t what he expected and that it was a mistake to go. If that&rsquo;s also the case, <a href="https://ealing.nub.news/news/local-news/former-ealing-council-housing-leader-admits-he-39made-a-mistake39-accepting-3000-from-developer-for-cannes-property-conference" title="Ealing Nub news article on current Ealing Council Leader Peter Mason's admission that accepting developers' gifts and hospitality was a mistake">why was it a mistake</a>?</p>
<p><strong>How can we be sure that the new council leader and his administration won&rsquo;t continue making these mistakes and taking the side of developers rather than standing up for the residents they are elected to represent?</strong></p>
<h3 id="local--action">Local  Action</h3>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/726113aef4.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy encouraging reporting of air quality concerns and action to be taken in response"></p>
<p><strong>If the soil is now clean and the air is safe to breathe, why would stopping works during hot weather (which didn’t happen in 2018), and covering stockpiles (why weren’t they covered already?) be given as examples of possible mitigating actions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>There must be a new commitment to work with and for residents where these are issues. Air pollution and odour nuisance reporting and investigation procedures need to be overhauled as they are currently not fit for purpose (reporting process too convoluted, each one investigated as a single, isolated incident rather than as part of an ongoing problem, residents are simply not believed and our reports are minimised and invalidated).</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/2cf1bdd0de.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on Local Actions to Improve Air Quality"></p>
<p><strong>Work on the Gasworks site is due to complete in 2038. Why is the date for net-zero emissions set for twelve years after this date in 2050?</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a similar commitment to target zero-emissions for construction vehicles by 2040, which is two years after the new draft local Plan period for new developments ends.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/4843e8295e.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy on campaigning for more regulatory powers"></p>
<p><strong>What has Ealing Council done to date to campaign for greater regulatory powers and for a Clean Air Act? Please give examples.</strong></p>
<p>This draft Air Quality Strategy is fine in many respects in terms of the words it contains, but what concerns me is that these are empty words if they are not acted on and enforced.</p>
<p>Recent history strongly suggests the council doesn&rsquo;t have the leadership, organisational culture or political will to act in the interests of its most vulnerable residents in Southall.</p>
<h3 id="active-travel">Active Travel</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about active travel and Ealing Council&rsquo;s multi-million pound Let&rsquo;s Go Southall campaign in the draft Strategy, but <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/825485/response/1997481/attach/html/5/FOI%20Response%2022%200079%20FINAL.pdf.html" title="Let's Go Southall Freedom of Information Request">very little on its real cost and impact</a>. They seem to have about 50 regular weekly activity groups. Over two years that&rsquo;s 5,000 sessions. 30,000 attendances (not individuals). So average of six people per session? 1,000 people attended at least two sessions (repeat attendances). My guess would be not many more than 1,000 in total, most will be repeaters (thinking GP referrals, lots of organisers?). If it&rsquo;s helped 1,000 individuals, that&rsquo;s £5,400 per person. If 10,000 it&rsquo;s £540 per person (still seems like a lot of money). And there&rsquo;s no evidence that it&rsquo;s helped anyone!</p>
<p><strong>The council must be open and transparent with residents that Let&rsquo;s Go Southall is a top-down neoliberal behavioural change (&ldquo;nudge theory&rdquo;) programme led by a retired stockbroker, and not the &ldquo;grassroots social movement&rdquo; of the council&rsquo;s Orwellian publicity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the Council is serious about improving safe active travel options in Southall, then it must improve road and pavement conditions and safety first. Many of the roads and pavements are not fit to cycle or walk on, especially for children and families, older people, and people with disabilities.</strong></p>

<h1 id="air-quality-action-plan">Air Quality Action Plan</h1>
<h2 id="the-2017-2022-action-plan">The 2017-2022 Action Plan</h2>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/f573809dce.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution" title="Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating Low Emission Neighbourhoods implemented in areas of low air pollution"></p>
<p>a. Included a number of no-or-low-impact schemes such as Low Emission Neighbourhoods (LENs), implemented in 2021 as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). The Action Plan itself states that there is no (or, elsewhere, conflicting) evidence that LENs/LTNs reduce air pollution within the designated area, and that there is evidence that they increase air pollution outside it. The Action Plan also states that LENs/LTNs are often implemented in areas of relatively low air pollution. <strong>Surely it would be better to reduce traffic in areas with high levels of air pollution?</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/8be373b743.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don&rsquo;t reduce air pollution" title="Screenshot from Ealing's 2017-22 Air Quality Action Plan stating that speed control measures don't reduce air pollution"></p>
<p>b. Similarly, a 20mph zone was implemented borough-wide, yet the Action Plan states there is no evidence that speed reduction zones produce a reduction in emissions. The Plan states that there is a perception that road safety is improved. <strong>Perhaps the Council will reflect on the road safety issues associated with its promotion of the uptake of much heavier electric vehicles while reducing road space for vehicles.</strong></p>
<p>c. Another low impact scheme was Play Streets. <strong>How many Play Streets are there now? How often do they run? Where are they?</strong></p>
<p>d. <strong>How many Pocket Parks are there? Where are they?</strong></p>
<p>e. <strong>How many Green Screens  are there? Where are they? Why were green screens not erected at Southall Gasworks even after residents complained of dust from the site in their homes?</strong></p>
<p>f. <strong>How are these schemes evaluated in terms of reducing air pollution? Where are the air quality monitors located to record baseline measurements to compare against air pollution levels during or after the scheme is in place?</strong></p>
<p>g. <strong>Enforcement of anti-idling laws was deemed &ldquo;not cost-effective&rdquo;. Smoke control was not deemed a problem and therefore not promoted or enforced. Who made these decisions?</strong></p>
<p>h. <strong>What is the wider &lsquo;cost&rsquo; to residents in not taking enforcement action against these criminal behaviours?</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-2022-2027-action-plan-aqap">The 2022-2027 Action Plan (AQAP)</h2>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/73f624c5da.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Strategy stating the difficulty in evaluating the impact of individual actions with air quality monitoring data alone"></p>
<p><strong>If air pollution monitoring data cannot inform the efficacy of individual actions, how can it be used in combination with secondary data to do so?</strong> I&rsquo;m sure there must be a sensible explanation, but to most people I suspect this statement makes little sense. In Southall, we have continuously been asked to ignore our own lived experience of health and quality of life problems attributed to the open-air &lsquo;cleaning&rsquo; of a hundred years of petrochemical waste at the Gasworks site, in favour of the developer Berkeley&rsquo;s assurances that it&rsquo;s own monitoring of air quality is &lsquo;within acceptable limits&rsquo; and harmless to health. Public Health England published four risk assessments based on Berkeley&rsquo;s data, and came to similar conclusions, although neither looked at any secondary data. The air pollution data has still to be published so that the public can make up their own minds.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/b26fce3d39.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan showing impact scores from Low to High and how these relate to changes in levels of air pollution"></p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/a5185741a3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how imperceptible changes that cannot be detected by monitoring or modelling can be interpreted as Low Impact or a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>The Action Plan here seems to contradict the Strategy by stating that changes in the levels of air pollution above a certain level can be attributed even to individual actions (although more likely to be due to multiple actions).</p>
<p><strong>If the council is serious about using air pollution data and secondary data to establish efficacy of its air quality strategy and action plan, (which sounds sensible enough), then it must explain what measures it will use, and publish baseline data and regular updates.</strong></p>
<p>Like it does with its <a href="https://ealingperformance.inphase.com/Plan/856" title="Ealing Council Performance Dashboard">performance dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the Council&rsquo;s own evaluation of its 2017-22 Action Plan, I would suggest that its achievements are minimal, and misleading.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/251858/2025/6aa8ea88ed.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Ealing&rsquo;s draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan" title="Screenshot from Ealing's draft Air Quality Action Plan evaluating success of previous action plan"></p>
<p>Electric Vehicle charging points (p. 30 of 2022 AQAP) were not actually a specified target in the 2017 AQAP, so I&rsquo;m unsure how this can be claimed as an achievement? Similarly with School Streets and specific cycle lanes. LENS/LTNs were specified as a target, but there is no mention of that fiasco here. <strong>Air quality monitoring data must be used to locate pollution hotspots for any future implementation of LENs/LTNs</strong></p>
<p>The 20 mph speed limit was implemented borough-wide, but only since December 2021. Why did it take so long? What is the use of it if it isn’t enforced, especially in Southall?</p>

			 <p>There will be 14,800 new homes in 23 new developments in Southall over the next few years. 14 units over 10 stories high, and 7 over 20 stories high. Up to 40,000 new residents (and their cars)!</p>
<p>One third of the total new developments in the whole of Ealing borough (only Acton is getting it worse).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So not happening so much in the &lsquo;white&rsquo; or richer areas of the borough, for some reason.</p>
<p>None of these homes will be genuinely affordable to most people currently living in overcrowded homes in Southall or Ealing, as Studio bedsit flats start at around £300,000!</p>
<p>Most will stay empty until they are sold to investors from China, Malaysia, Singapore, Bahrain(!) where they are actively marketed by the greedy property developers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The same property developers who gave former Ealing Council &lsquo;Leader&rsquo; Julian Bell and new Ealing Council &lsquo;Leader&rsquo; Peter Mason (also a Southall Green ward councillor) over £30,000 in recent years to holiday in the south of France at the MIPIM property festival in Cannes described as a &ldquo;booze &lsquo;n&rsquo; hookerfest&rdquo; by Private Eye Magazine.</p>
<p>Bell says, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t cost the taxpayer a penny&rdquo;, but in Southall we are already paying with our health and quality of life thanks to the poisonous air from the development of the contaminated old gasworks site (due to complete in 2038!).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Town planner Mason says it was a mistake, and not what he expected(!).</p>
<p>Where will 40,000 new residents' children go to school (and how will they get there and back), how will they get an appointment to see a GP, which hospital will they go to when they need emergency treatment, and how will they get there on the roads already regularly gridlocked by too much traffic?</p>
<p>Worth taking the time to have a look at <a href="https://stopthetowers.info/other-campaigns.">stopthetowers.info/other-cam&hellip;</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Cllr Mason recommended we read Bob Colenutt&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Property Lobby: The Hidden Reality Behind the Housing Crisis&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>What Colenutt says (and he has a wealth of experience in local authority housing and planning, and in the community resisting property developers), is that developers do have too much power (as Mason argues), but also that local councils and councillors do not do enough to resist, do not have the negotiating skills (contrary to how Mason originally described the importance of trips to MIPIM to &lsquo;negotiate hard&rsquo;), and too readily embrace the &lsquo;financialisation&rsquo; of the land and property market brought about by David Cameron&rsquo;s and Nick Clegg&rsquo;s ConDem government in 2010.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So now, we have a very real housing crisis fuelling the huge profits of private developers, all facilitated and egged on by mostly Labour councils too easily rolling over and allowing them to build fewer and fewer &lsquo;genuinely affordable homes&rsquo; (because &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the profit in that?&quot;).</p>
<p>What Colenutt says loudly and clearly is that without ordinary people&rsquo;s and communities' resistance it would be so much worse, and that to all intents and purposes councils and councillors are in bed with the developers.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, it was time for the Ealing Labour AGM in May 2021.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Just to recap on how we got here. Bell&rsquo;s autocratic and failing leadership. And some high level debate about who is worse, Bell or Mason.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Not sure what the leaks referred to are?

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->One councillor was particularly scathing about then leader Julian Bell&rsquo;s exclusivity, lack of accountability, corruption and even theft! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The councillor makes the case for Peter Mason being a better alternative than Bell (a low bar, admittedly).<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Mason transformed Ealing Labour when he joined in 2009. (Anyone who believes Mason offers anything new is very sadly mistaken. He was practically running the show!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->For all the &lsquo;good&rsquo; Peter Mason did in transforming Ealing Labour since 2009, he has his very serious flaws!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Peter Mason is callous, ruthless, sectarian. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This is from one of his own Labour councillors, rewarded with a place in his cabinet! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->So this was the choice many Labour councillors felt they were faced with when voting for their leader (and ours) last May.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Corrupt, incompetent liar Bell vs. callous, ruthless, sectarian Mason.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
They chose the latter, some feathering their own nests in the process. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks to everyone who&rsquo;s following, commenting and retweeting this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#EalingLabourLeaks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> thread.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
To finish off, here&rsquo;s how one of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#LabourFamily<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of councillors describes our MP Virendra Sharma. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->And just to finish off, back to Cllr Mik Sabiers (Bell&rsquo;s assistant liar in the LTN fiasco), who isn&rsquo;t standing in the May elections because he isn&rsquo;t eligible.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The question is, was he eligible in 2018? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>Took me an hour (as opposed to 10 minutes) to drive my lad home from school this afternoon, thanks in part to the High Traffic Neighbourhood (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18k_2hRx7EC4ov1mVrzH0GzV3v-6hUH4W/view?usp=sharing">&lsquo;Improving access for HGVs&rsquo;</a>) in Southall &lsquo;Green&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Like a rat, I tried the side streets and back roads option and found those to be jammed, too, and Scotts Road - although confusingly still two-way throughout - is now No Entry from the eastern end.</p>
<p>I would have abandoned my car and got out and walked/scooted home, but there was nowhere to leave it - all the pavements (and even the double yellow lines) were parked on, or being used by, er, pedestrians.</p>
<p>The more virtuous brothers and sisters amongst us may righteously question why me and my lad weren&rsquo;t scooting/walking anyway? Why are we driving when Southall is known for its traffic gridlock?</p>
<p>We have done it a couple of times. It takes us 40 minutes each way in fine weather. My lad would love to do it every day, I&rsquo;m sure, although not in the wind, cold and rain. I don&rsquo;t believe my dodgy feet/knees/hips/back would manage it daily, either.</p>
<p>And why are we going to a school so far away from where we live?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the best (and happiest) school in Southall. And it&rsquo;s the one that is furthest away from the gasworks stink and toxic air. We wanted to give our little asthmatic boy some clean air five days a week, if we could. (Of course, we since found out the school is under the Heathrow flight path, and next to the smoky narrowboats moored on the canal&hellip;.).</p>
<p>(In case you are wondering, the ambulance somehow squeezed down the middle of Western Road, fortunately no well-intentioned bollards or planters in the way.)</p>
